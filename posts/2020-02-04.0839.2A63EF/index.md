Emmy Jewel has no idea what she's talking about, and it shows. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.

Nobody is looking at a child’s behavior and deciding the child is trans.

Trans kids often have to beg and plead to be taken seriously by their parents, and the parents will try EVERYTHING ELSE before believing them, if they ever do. Even when the parents do believe it and start advocating, the child still has to convince at least two medical professionals *without the parent present* before they’ll be allowed puberty blockers. Reactionaries really have no idea how hard it is to get trans care.

No one is transing kids!! It doesn’t happen!
