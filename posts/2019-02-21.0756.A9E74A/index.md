It’s another rainy day here in SD so I’m back to shorter skirts. I love this Stretch is Comfort pocket skirt so much, it’s so extremely versatile, I wear it constantly. It’s especially good when you want to wear a bodycon dress but just don’t have the confidence to pull off the visible belly outline today.

Tonight I have my 12th laser hair removal session. It’s so funny how gleeful I get about the prospect of deliberately burning my face.
