A UK hate group named TransgenderTrend has begun a campaign of misinformation against trans people. One choice nugget they’re spreading is the age old myth that trans women’s vaginas are “gaping wounds” that will heal closed if given the chance. This is a blatant lie that originated in a book by Germain Greer, one of the original TERFs.

So this is a good time to resurrect this almost two year old thread by Christine Burns about how false this narrative is.

Neovaginas are functionally identical to natal vaginas. In most cases they’re even composed of the same tissues (sometimes grafting is required for extra depth). They self lubricate (yes, some trans women have WAP), they are self cleaning, they maintain a microfauna ecosystem just like natal vaginas (and yes, trans women can get yeast infections).

Furthermore: All transgender bottom surgeries were invented FOR CIS PEOPLE. Vaginoplasty and phalloplasty were both developed to repair organs damaged due to explosions or other accidents, because even cis people experience major psychological pain at having malformed bits.
