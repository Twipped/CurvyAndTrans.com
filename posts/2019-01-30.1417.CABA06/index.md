Today’s eye look is courtesy of January’s @boxycharm, which included this awesome Tarte Cosmetics pallet that I am loving for its subtle purple tones.

This Wander Beauty mascara also came in that box and oh my god do I love this product. The lash separation and lift is wonderful, its become my default mascara now.

My skin was in pretty good shape today so I skipped foundation or BB cream entirely
