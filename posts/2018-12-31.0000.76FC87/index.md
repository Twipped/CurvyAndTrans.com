2018 was a year of constant reminder that I put too much stock in the opinions and reactions of the people I love. Time and time again it caused us both pain, and continues to do so. I have so much trauma wrapped up in my own sense of failure to meet the expectations of others, and so much rejection felt from others failing to meet my own.

I’m probably going to mess thus up a lot, but I’m going to try very hard to get better.
