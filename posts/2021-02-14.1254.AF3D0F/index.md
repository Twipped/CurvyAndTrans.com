I’ve stayed away from “chestfeeding” discourse because it’s not my lane, but transphobes keep throwing it into the transfemme side of the road, and this thread explains why.

Trans men and non-binary transmascs exist in nearly a 1:1 ratio to transfems, but they are consistently ignored in transphobic discourse. It happens with breastfeeding, it happens with pregnancy, it happens with conversations about menstruation and menstrual products. There was a big stink last year about Always dropping the venus symbol from pad packaging to be more inclusive of non-women, and terfs were all blaming trans women for it.
