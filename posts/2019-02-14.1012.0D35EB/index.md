This is actually yesterday’s OOTD but I wasn’t in the mindset yesterday to edit the photos for a post. I love this Nemidor dress from off Amazon, it hugs me so nicely in the upper body and it has pockets! It’s a tiny bit loose in the chest on me when I sit down, but thats why I wear a cami with it.
