My wife got me this awesome Aesthetica Cosmetics lip contouring kit as a stocking stuffer, along with a neon eye shadow pallet, and I put both to use today. I found this top when browsing at Walmart last week and instantly knew I had to pair it with my Holy Clothing Talia skirt. The two just fit perfectly together.

I took down my photo lighting rig for Christmas, and havenâ€™t put it back up yet, so things little a little off on these photos. The sun was very bright this morning.
