Hastily threw together this look this morning, since my wife was asleep in bed next me while I got dressed.
Thankfully my skin is doing very good today, since I didn’t even take the time to do BB Cream. Just some quick eye shadow and liner, and then scurrying out the door after my son came in, so he wouldn’t wake her up.

My hair is finally getting back to its full curl potential after I last dyed it. After the hair cut I’ve had to roll back some of my methods, because what worked at mid-back length doesn’t work so well for neck length. This time I colored it using a Maddison Reed kit, my first time using them. I hope to have a product review up this week, I keep getting distracted from writing it.
