Felt very sassy this morning.

Had this dress in my closet for almost a year. Kat bought it for herself but didn’t like the way it fit. She couldn’t return it and was going to just put it in the donate box, but I wanted to hang on to it until I could fit into it. That day has arrived.

A colorful dress required a colorful eye look, so I broke out my rainbow.
