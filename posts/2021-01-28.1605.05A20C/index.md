This is so real, for all forms of marginalization. WASPy types will go way out of their way to avoid actually facing uncomfortable truths, even if it means getting extremely angry at their own strawman. Trans people face this exact same wall when trying to educate cis people on how their behaviors harm us. *Especially* when they know they’re in the wrong but don’t want to admit it because it makes them feel ugly.

Twitch streamer Negaoryx put it very well the other day:

> Someone is holding a mirror up to you and it makes you uncomfortable, because you know you and you know the parts of you that are good. So in your heart, you have to come up with a narrative that makes you feel better about the fact that someone is asking you to confront the parts of you that you hate the most— me asking you to hold yourself accountable to be a better person, because you aren’t right now.
