Quick evening look for a dinner date with my wife. My skin has been in pretty fantastic shape this week and I have no idea why. ðŸ˜…

My mom was watching the kids for us tonight while we were out to dinner. As we were leaving the house my daughter complimented Kat on her outfit, so I asked what she thought of mine. The silence from my mother was deafening. She was so silent that she consumed the sound around her. It was a black hole of awkward silences.

Well let her be awkward, itâ€™s her fault we canâ€™t enjoy this together.
