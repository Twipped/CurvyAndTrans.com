Picked this dress up from Torrid yesterday, in exchange for the two bras I bought Monday that ended up being completely the wrong fit. I love this dress, it’s multi-layered and poofs our like there is a petticoat under it. The twirl factor is intense! Not very used to wearing something this exposing on the chest, but it feels very empowering.

Today’s eye look was actually meant for a different outfit, but it didn’t play out the way it did in my head, so I switched to this dress instead.

Tried a new shampoo this morning because the Shea Moisture Curl Shampoo seemed to be doing the opposite of what it’s meant for and my hair was getting more and more damaged. The Hair Food brand that I had been using has disappeared from shelves, so now I’m trying to figure out what else works for my hair. Probably need to bite the bullet and buy some DevaCurl.
