This is the outfit from two Wednesdays ago that I never got around to posting because my cycle sapped all my motivation. It wasnâ€™t a terribly amazing look, but cute enough to warrant a lazy Sunday evening post.

This skirt was the first thing I bought from [Holy Clothing](https://holyclothing.com/) and I immediately fell in love with it, so much so that I bought it again in black.
