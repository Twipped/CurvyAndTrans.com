I love petticoats, but I wear them very rarely because thats a bit extra even for me. This dress, however, needs a petticoat, just to complete the look.

I have this dress in three different colors (and sizes), and I absolutely adore it for when I'm in the mood for a vintage look. This particular dress is the green options in size 22, and it fits me perfectly. My one complaint is that the polyester gets very static charged in dry weather. Without a petticoat the dress clings to itself and cannot be worn with cotton leggings.

You can just barely see my Sachi bra poking out in the crook of the neck line.
