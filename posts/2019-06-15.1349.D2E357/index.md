Threw this together for an Ulta trip today to replenish my DevaCurl supply. Curly hair takes so much conditioner!! It’s hard to see in this potato photo, but I’m wearing a maxi skirt here that I don’t think I’ve never worn in public before. It’s very tight around my belly, and usually my dysmorphia kicks in and my belly feels huge and I end up switching to something that flares out. It didn’t happen today.

My body dysmorphia has been almost nonexistent since getting on an antidepressant, which I did not expect to happen. I see myself the way everyone else does, and it’s pretty nice.
