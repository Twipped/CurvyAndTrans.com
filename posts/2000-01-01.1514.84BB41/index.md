### Prelude: Summer of 1986, I'm five years old.
<a href="../02-1.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../02-1.jpeg" alt="" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">My Grandmother kissing my face at the 1981 Jehovah's Witness District Convention, Pontiac Michigan.</span></a>I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. My mother, my father, my grandmother, one of my uncles, his wife, and two of my three cousins are Witnesses. My entire social circle growing up was JWs. The only life I knew until my 20s was in the JW faith.

Back then the JWs had three yearly events: two circuit assemblies and one big district convention. Our district convention was held in the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan (a district of Detroit). The DC is a big deal, it's one of the largest social events of the year. Since the JW faith prioritizes friendships and relationships within the church (very strongly discouraging extra-faith association), these are often the biggest opportunities for meeting new friends and for single people to find romantic interests. Thus, everybody always wears their finest (tho not too ostentatious, must remain modest and humble). That year, my mother had sewn for me a five piece child's suit. It was navy blue with vertical pin stripes, single breasted, double button, notched lapel jacket, a matching waistcoat, and shorts (because it's July in Michigan in a very large football stadium), worn over a white button up shirt with a clip on tie. I imagine I looked like quite the dapper five year old boy.

I hated that suit. I hated the way it fit my body, I hated the way it made me hot, I hated how I felt when I wore it. It constricted me when I moved, binding in my shoulders and groin, making it harder to run. It was just wrong, it felt wrong on my body. Most of my friends at the time were girls, partly because that's just how our congregation was, but also because I never got along well with any boys my age. All my friends were wearing beautiful dresses, had bows in their long hair, and just looked really pretty. That's what I wanted too; I wanted to be pretty. I remember resenting anyone who ever told me I looked handsome. I hated that word.

### A Strange Child

I was born one month premature on October 9th, 1980, delivered by cesarean due to preeclampsia. My parents could not decide on what to name me; my father preferred the name Jarvis, but my mother wanted the name Jordan. Apparently they hadn't been putting much discussion into the topic, because my mom says they decided on these names the day I was born. I asked her what name she would have gone with had I been born female, but she didn't have an answer. Unable to reach an agreement, they went with both, and I was given the name Jarvis-Jordan Allen Badgley (Allen being my father's name). My Dad and all of his family always called me Jarvis, but my mother and her family called me Jory (one of my uncles still to this day calls me JJ). Within the JW congregation, it was split, with most of the women and kids also calling me Jory, and most of the men calling me Jarvis (how patriarchal).

At the age of three I decided that I didn't like the name Jordan, and I definitely didn't like the name Jory; it didn't fit me right. I believe my reasoning at the time was that it was boring and the name Jarvis was much more unique and interesting (and Jory was infantizing). I suspect I may have also felt that Jarvis was less masculine, by virtue of being less common (this might just me be projecting my current feelings, however).  I told everyone that I knew that I wanted to be called Jarvis from then on. Some people resisted it, but most accepted my choice, including my mother, despite being sad that I had sided with my father. She says my dad was smug as hell.

<a href="../02-2.jpeg" class="card left span5"><img src="../02-2.jpeg" alt="Me in my backyard, playing with a set of deer antlers." class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Fall, 1982</span></a>When I was about four years old one of my friends in the congregation, an older girl around 10 or 11, suddenly didn't want to play with me any more. I couldn't understand why, and I asked my mom. She explained that the girl was at an age when girls stop wanting to play with boys, and because I was a boy, that meant she didn't want to be around me any more. I was so upset by this, it just didn't make any sense. I have to assume at this point that I _did_ understand the concept of sex, but I didn't get why that difference should affect who you got to play with. I didn't see anything about me that was different from her, aside from our age. We both enjoyed the same games, we did the same activities, why couldn't we be friends? The experience left me feeling very confused and frustrated; I didn't feel like a boy, I didn't relate to any of the boys I knew, but here I had this significant event which said undeniably that I _was_ a boy, and because of that I was being denied something I wanted very badly. The memory sat on my psyche like a cinder-block and firmly entrenched the idea that, no matter how I felt, I had to be a boy.

I don't remember having any bias in the toys I played with. My mom always prided herself on not reinforcing stereotypes in my play, so I had a pretty wide diversity in toys. I had matchbox cars and Star Wars action figures-- yes, the original figures, the ones that would be worth tons of money today if we still had them. My mother removed the light-sabers that slid out of the arms because I wasn't allowed to have weapons. I also had dolls and a toy kitchen, a Rainbow Brite and Starlite toy that I think we got from a garage sale, and I remember I was really into cabbage patch kids at one point. I also had my fair share of stuffed animals, some of which were homemade. Still to this day I'm quite obsessed with plushies. I played with LEGO a _lot_ and would construct my own ships and buildings to make-believe with, but I never had an interest in sports or really any traditionally masculine activities. My dad was (and still is) a deer hunter and loved his guns and bows, but I never felt much desire to be involved in any of that and never wanted to go hunting with him. I did love to bake, however, and I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with my mother. I also enjoyed sewing, tho I didn't actively pursue it until middle school.

<a href="../01.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../01.jpeg" alt="Me in my backyard with an Australian Shepherd puppy, sitting in tall grass, our house visible behind me." class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Summer, 1986</span></a>My mother describes me as an "Extremely Sensitive" child. From infancy I was very atypical in my behavior, and quickly prone to explosive fits. She tells stories about how women would judge her for carrying me facing forward instead of laying across her shoulder, because I would always get very upset if I couldn't see what was happening. I didn't like to be held in any of the typical ways people hold infants. I was always very quick to emotional outbursts, crying at the drop of a hat, and would have my feelings hurt extremely easily.  Because of this, when it became time for me to start schooling, my mother decided that it would be a very bad idea for me to be put into the local school district.

### Schooled

The area we lived in was predominantly farm country, and farmer kids are... a type. The children in our area were known for being very mean, the school district had a massive bullying problem. It also wasn't well funded, and my mother didn't believe I would receive a good education from those schools.  So, she did something completely radical at the time... she home schooled me. She was the first home schooling parent that school district had even had, the first in any of the neighboring counties, and she wrote to home schooling associations to get help and materials to convince the school district to allow her to do so under regulation and testing.  Consequently, for kindergarten through third grade I was taught at home by my mom.

<a href="../02-3.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../02-3.jpeg" alt="" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Winter 1983/84</span></a>I don't remember much about how we did this. I know she obtained a school desk from the local university, which I would sit at and do worksheets. I excelled at sciences and reading (I know at 4th grade I tested at a 6th grade reading level), but struggled with writing and maths. I had a very hard time with hand writing, and to this day have dreadful penmanship. I remember that my mom would try to find real world examples of things to help me understand concepts. She also enabled my desire to conduct science experiments and learn how things work (tho she also had plenty of bad stories about this as well).

She obtained a Commodore Vic-20 with a cassette tape drive when I was around 6, and showed me how you could type programs into it and make things happen. I didn't really learn how to program, however, but I loved the computer itself. Around the same time my grandmother bought her first home PC, an IBM PC that she got used from Central Michigan University. It had two 5.75" floppy drives and an orange monochrome screen. I remember playing [Castle Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaKtZYMBbwM) on it, using the arrow keys to move a single character around inside a castle. I believe this was the first computer game I ever played. There probably were some arcade machines in our town at grocery stores or something, but I never got to play them.

### An Ideal Childhood

<a href="../02-4.jpeg" class="card left span4"><img src="../02-4.jpeg" alt="Me, sitting atop the split wood pile next to our house" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Summer, 1986</span></a>My father was a construction worker and usually lived in hotels near the sites he worked on, so most of the time it was just me and my mom at home. I spent my days wandering around in the woods behind our house with our family dog along side, chasing toads and trying to catch turtles, overturning rocks to find garter snakes. I would dig holes and create underground forts. There was a tree that had been hollowed out by wood peckers, and one year a bee hive formed inside it. I remember leaning my head against the tree and hearing the bees.  A creek ran through the middle of our land and I'd often go down and play in it during the summer, or sometimes just sit next to it and watch the water striders skim across the surface of the still corners of the stream. In the winter, parts of the creek would freeze over and I'd go out on the ice. It would inevitably break and I'd fall into the creek and end up running back up the snowy hill completely soaked through my coveralls, but that never kept me from doing it again.

<a href="../02-5.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../02-5.jpeg" alt="Me and my dog sitting in our back yard, with a forest in view behind. A swingset and tricycle are visible in the grass." class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Fall, 1986</span></a>We had chickens, and my dog and I would chase them around their enclosure. There was a gravenstein apple tree in the yard, which I would climb up and pull apples off to eat (not often tho, because gravensteins are quite sour).  When my mom would have a meal ready she would open the door and call my name, and I'd come running up to the house. Looking back on it, it's like something out of a 60s family tv series. Griffin, our Australian Shepherd, was basically my Lassie. By most people's standards I had an idyllic childhood.

Unfortunately, all such stories have a dark side, and that was my father. My dad is a direct misogynist of the "women belong in the kitchen" variety; full blown woman hater. The type of man that today would be labeled a mens rights activist and an incel.  He was tremendously abusive to my mother, both physically and emotionally. Some times he would be dismissed from a work site ahead of schedule and would come home a few days before we expected him. He would go into a rage because there wouldn't be a meal waiting for him on the table, even tho we had no idea he was going to be home. I know I was frequently afraid of him, and would have anxiety when he was home, but other than that have very few memories of him from these times because I've blocked them all out. None of the memories I do have are pleasant. I remember being hogtied with duct-tape when I would misbehave. I also remember that I always wanted my mother to be the one to spank me when I was bad, because she'd use her hand, or a fly swatter, but my dad would use a belt.

### A New Home

<a href="../03.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../03.jpeg" alt="" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Spring 1992</span></a>My parents finally separated when I was nine. She and I moved two towns over to Mount Pleasant, where Central Michigan University is based, and where my grand parents lived (separately). My mom found a job cleaning glassware for minimum wage at the university, and through a friend connection happened to find a house in town to rent for only $100 per month. It was actually a pretty large home, probably about 1500 square feet. Three bedrooms, huge livingroom, decently sized kitchen and a dining room. It also had a pretty large yard, and the forest behind it backed up to the river. The reason the house was so cheap was because it was a shithole. It was built on a flood plane, and despite sitting on a four foot rise, it still had flooded several times. You could see on the walls where the water level had been.

I can remember every detail of this house, from forest green carpet and beige linoleum in the kitchen, to the speckled ceiling tiles in the bedrooms. The livingroom had a huge vaulted ceiling with two skylights in it, but the skylights were perpetually covered in leaves from all the trees around the house. The only heating was from a space heater in the livingroom, so we used small cube heaters in our bedrooms. The livingroom walls had that wood paneling that was so common in the 70s and 80s. The entire house stank of mildew and probably had a ton of mold in the walls.

The house water supply was fed by a well in the front yard. Unfortunately, the well was contaminated with sulfur, bad enough that you could smell it when you turned on the water. It was not drinkable, and tho we would occasionally shower in it if we were desperate, we never got our hair wet. Not that you could take much of a shower, because the syphon well pump was so poor that there was almost no water pressure. I took baths at my grandmothers house, and my mom would wash at the gym. It didn't have a clothes washer either, of course, so my mom and I went to the laundromat every week.

The refrigerator didn't work when we first moved in to the house, so for the first six months my mom would give me fifty cents every morning to run across the street to a convenience store and buy a pint of milk to use for my cereal. Eventually the owner got the fridge repaired, but something was clearly wrong with it, because if I touched the fridge and the sink at the same time I could feel current passing through my body.

Behind the house was a fenced off space that at one time had been a dog run, but was just piled full of trash from previous tenants. For the first year we didn't touch it, and instead built a new covered dog run further out in the yard. At night it was my job to go out there and let the dogs back into the house, but there was very little light behind the house and I was afraid of the dark woods, so every time I would run as fast as I possibly could out to the dog cage, flip open the latch, and then run back to the house with the dogs alongside.

At one point my mother got the idea that we should raise some chickens again, and she got a dozen baby chicks. We laid down newspaper in the back wetroom and setup heat lamps. When the chickens got too large to keep in that room, we finally cleared out the garbage from behind the house, repaired the fence, and built a small roosting house so the space could become a chicken run. I don't remember what ever happened to those chickens...

Of course, now that my mom was working full time to support us, that meant that I couldn't be home schooled any more, and that's when things really started to suck.

### The Feminine Boy

Growing up home-schooled in the JW faith meant spending a lot of time in the door-to-door field service work. The women of the faith, especially those who were home-makers (and really, back then that was most of them), were expected to be in the field service work for most of the week, and certainly on weekends. I, of course, went with her, and that meant that most of my time was spent around women. Because of this, I think my mother never really noticed how many feminine traits I was exhibiting as a child, or if she did she assumed I was just emulating the women around me. Unfortunately she refuses to acknowledge any of these traits, even the ones I remember, and claims that she doesn't "believe" in gendered behavior.

I entered public school for the first time in fourth grade. I was a tremendously awkward child, in no small part because the only socialization I had received was within the JW church. I related to most of the world via bible stories, and would refer to that on a regular basis. I was also still very sensitive to negative responses from other kids, and wow were non-witness kids mean. I was quite the teacher's pet and constantly was interrupting class to ask questions and make comments. This drew a lot of ire from my classmates, and it wasn't long before bullying started, and the bullies drilled right in on how feminine I was. My manner of speak, the way I moved, my responses, my interests, the fact that I cried so much... Pretty soon kids started calling me names, names like Gay, Fairy, and Faggot.

I looked these words up and found myself scratching my head. Of course, growing up in a strictly conservative religious environment, the only thing I knew about sex was that you didn't do it with someone you weren't married to, and why would a boy marry a boy? Why would they think I was attracted to boys? I had never even heard of someone being gay. First of all, I was nine years old and hadn't hit puberty yet, I wasn't attracted to anybody! Even if I was, however, it certainly wouldn't be boys.  Boys had _always_ been mean to me, always caused fights and acted cruel. Even among the witness kids, the boys just never liked playing with me.

The bullying escalated over the years. I remember frequently being shoved into the girls bathroom whenever our class would be moving within the school (like for P.E. or library time). "That's where you belong" is what they would say to me. The few boys who were nice to me soon distanced from me because they would also get made fun of for hanging around with "the gay kid". The girls weren't any help either, because this was right at that age when girls stop being friends with boys, purely on principle. One day while I was on the playground another boy ran up behind me and pulled down my shorts and underwear. They wanted to see if I actually had a penis.

Then puberty hit.

I hated my life, I hated my body, I despised my classmates. You might be inclined to say "Oh, so does every teenager," but no, this was much deeper than typical teen angst. In my fifth grade year book I drew over the faces of the children who hurt me the most, but no photo was defaced any where near as much as my own. I scratched it out so hard that I dug through the paper and made a whole. I _loathed_ my face, in photos, in reflections, everywhere. Every time I saw my own body I was wracked with pain and anguish. Of course, everyone would just say "Oh, nobody likes what they look like," but it was so much more than that. That face was not mine, it couldn't be mine. I didn't know why it couldn't be mine, but it wasn't.

The JW Kingdom Hall in Mount Pleasant had a very large mirror on the wall in the mudroom (aka, entry coat room for those of you who didn't grow up in inclimate weather regions). Sometimes when I was bored during the program I would go to the bathroom and then duck in to there there and just stare at that mirror, seething with hatred. Who was this boy? Who was this ugly person staring back at me?

From the age of 12 to 15 me and several of the boys in our JW congregation would go on a weekend trip to Ludington State Park, on Lake Michigan. One of the dads owned a camping trailer that he pulled with a giant conversion van. We'd all load up and spend two nights in the Cedar campground, cooking over the fire pit and riding our bikes on the forest trails or hiking along the beach dunes. At night we would play hide and seek in the woods next to our campsite. These trips were already pretty hard because while these kids were the closest thing I had to friends, I still wasn't one of them. We hung out because we had no one else to hang out with, friendships forced by common faith. One year they brought a camcorder with them and recorded this group of motley teen boys during their shenanigans. When I saw the video of myself, it filled me with dread. Something deep inside my brain said "that's not you" and it horrified me.

### Depersonalization

There is [an episode of Star Trek TNG](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Clues_(episode)) where the Enterprise crew wakes up after having lost a bunch of time and finds a bunch of clues that just don't add up. At one point in the episode Deanna Troi is in her quarters, goes to the bathroom, and screams.

> The mirror... I came in here...   
> and I looked into the mirror...   
> It wasn't me, Worf... Not me...   
> It was my face, but it wasn't me inside...   

It was kinda like that.

I became depressed, deeply depressed, and despondent. I started having suicidal ideation at 11 years old. In fifth grade I wrote and submitted an essay titled "Five reasons I want to kill myself". I don't even remember this, my mother told me about it the day I came out. The school staff rightfully became extremely concerned and my mother was forced to put me into therapy immediately (much to her chagrin; JWs don't believe in psychotherapy). I was put on anti-depressants, which made me feel even stranger and didn't actually make me happier.

Eventually my mother asked me "Do you feel like these drugs are making a difference?"

I replied "I can't really tell."

"Do you feel like the psychiatrist is helping?" she asked?

"Mom, that man is crazier than I am."

Eventually she put her foot down and took me off the medications, because it wasn't working. What did work for me.. was eating. I discovered I could eat my feelings away. Granted, we were poor, so there wasn't a lot of food _to_ eat, but I found my ways. Between the age of 9 and 11 I exploded into childhood obesity.

<a href="../obesity.jpeg" class="card center"><img src="../obesity.jpg" alt="Photos, age 7 to 13"></a>

After my parents separated I spent every weekend either at my Grandma's house, or at my Dad's. Part of this was out of tedium, because my mom's house was just so boring. My mother refused to have a television in the house, even one gifted by friends, because she felt it was a bad influence and caused lazy thinking.  At first my mom rented a three bedroom house just outside of town that was super cheap because it was on a river flood plane had been through a few very high floods. If I remember correctly, we paid just $100 per month, and the landlord would credit us if we made improvements to the house. Unfortunately this house was too far out of town for me to walk to anything, and was on a main highway into town, so I couldn't ride my bike. There was a back yard, but since it sat up against the Chippewa River, I was always plagued by mosquitoes if I tried to go outside. I hated that house, especially once the kids at school decided that we were living in rotted shack. From the street you could only see a tiny portion of the house, and it was old & water logged.

Every weekday I would ride the bus home from school, let myself into the house, and then would be alone for 3-4 hours until my mom got home. Nothing to do but listen to the radio and make-believe (I didn't even have books), so basically I just sat around the house and ate food. Initially it was simpler stuff, mac & cheese, peanut butter sandwiches, ramen... whatever we had on hand that a 10-11 year old could make without burning down the house. Cereal, oh so much cereal, both hot and cold. That was hampered somewhat in the early days because we didn't have a working refrigerator in the house, so dairy required going across the road to the convenience store and buying half a pint of milk.

Weekends at my grandmas meant I could pig out on all sorts of bad food. Cookies, bagels, chips, crackers, juice... Grandma's house was always full of carbs.  At my dads... well usually I'd be pretty hungry at my dad's because the man could barely feed himself, much less have food around for a tween. Meals usually consisted of venison steaks or burgers, or I'd have a bowl of corn flakes. What he would have a lot of, tho, was ice cream. He bought it in ten gallon containers from Schwans, or would get big boxes of Drumstick ice cream cones. If we went in to town I could usually convince him to stop at a gas station and buy me a soda and a candy bar. He also had a lot of loose change laying around, he collected it in big plastic buckets. I would sort out the change, roll it, and then walk or ride my bike in to town to exchange the rolls for candy. He got very angry when he discovered I was doing this, he said I was stealing from him (cuz that's a thing an 11 year old can do to their parent), but it didn't stop me. I just got more circumspect with it.

Because of our income status, my mom qualified for assisted living, which meant I got free school lunches. In elementary school the meals were pretty well calorie managed, but I'd eat all of it. Once I got into middle school, however, jackpot. The main entree was of course always a fixed item, but the salad bar was all you could fit on to your tray, and I could fit a lot. I would make massive salads piled high with all sorts of stuff, drown it in dressing, and then chow down.

My mother was very disturbed by how much weight I was putting on and kept trying to make me lose weight. She'd frequently nag me about my over eating and would tell me that if I didn't take care of my body now, I would deeply regret it when I was older. She was right, but at the time I really really didn't give a shit what happened to this sack of meat and bones that hosted the symbiote called my brain. That's all I could perceive my body as, a device to serve a purpose for keeping me alive and relocating me from point A to point B. I had no love for my flesh, and no concern for its well being.

My mom was constantly encouraging me to be more physically active, but was fairly powerless to do anything about it. She would take me to the university rec center and try to encourage me to run around the track. She kept telling me "It will make you feel better, the endorphins will kick in and you'll feel good." Never once in my life did physical exercise make me feel better, and as I got older it made me feel significantly worse. Today I know that this is because I had Inattentive ADHD, but back then it was believed that boys only got Hyperactive ADHD, which I didn't have the symptoms for. It wasn't until I was in college that I started to suspect I had ADHD, but my mother firmly denied it and gaslit me on it until I stopped pressing it. It wasn't until my thirties when I saw a list of ADHD symptoms and realized they all applied to me that I sought out a diagnoses.

When encouragement didn't work, my mom resorted to bribes, paying me to walk from my school to a meeting place on the college campus. I earned two dollars per day, which was added to a tin can at my grandmother's house, saving up to purchase a GameBoy (which I successfully did, after my grandmother matched my contribution half way). I actually didn't mind the walks so much, especially in the winter when there was snow on the ground.  Oh sure, I resented having to walk in the cold and the wet, but I found fun places along the way that made for entertaining diversions. A huge pine tree that turned into an igloo when the branches were weighted down with snow, for example. Various places where the snow plows would dump their loads, creating massive snow mountains to climb or dig into the side of. Streaks of black ice that I could "skate" across in my snow boots. The worst part was that by the time I'd be at the rec center to meet her, I'd be in quite a bit of discomfort.

Around the seventh grade I started to experience a dull throbbing pain in my groin any time I would perform any kind of intense physical activity, especially anything that required running. The more I ran, the more it hurt. It wasn't an intense pain, I could work through it, but it would make it extremely hard to keep running. I was always the last person to finish the mile run in P.E. because inevitably I would have to start walking because of the pain. I of course told my mom and my P.E. teachers that I was having this, but nobody could think of a reason why it would be happening, and since I was fat they just dismissed it as being obesity related. Sometimes I got the feeling they didn't believe I was in any pain at all, just faking it to get out of having the exercise. My classmates thought this as well, and it contributed further to my status as a pariah.

We didn't have health care, and we couldn't afford a clinic visit if it wasn't an emergency, so for most of my teen years I just had to live with this pain in my crotch. Finally in my senior year my mom took me to a doctor, but they couldn't find anything outwardly wrong with me that would explain it, and continued to just chalk it up to me being fat. I lived with this pain for most of my adult life, because nobody believed it enough to look closely. It wasn't until I was 26 years old that I learned about a testicular torsion when one of my co-workers' son had to have his corrected, but by this point the damage had well been done. My left testicle was destroyed, mangled and beaten from years of being choked to death by its own arteries. That didn't stop it from hurting tho, I continued to have pain from it and the spermatic cord well into my thirties.

### Envy and Rivalry

For about six months of that first year after the separation, my mom and I had two roommates: a woman named Judy and her daughter Meaghan. Judy was also recently separated from her abusive husband, and they lived with us while she got them back on their feet. Meaghan and I fought _constantly_, like siblings. The two of us were always at each others throats, bickering and sniping at each other constantly. I resented her presence in our house, and I _really_ didn't like Judy, but I think I also was expressing a lot of anger simply over how badly I wanted to be like her. Meaghan was (and still is) a short, freckled red head spitfire, which I absolutely admired. I was extremely jealous that she had so much that I wasn't allowed, as a boy.  One day I walked into the bathroom and found Meaghan's swim suit hanging over the shower curtain rod to dry. I remember looking up at it with longing, intensely wishing it were mine.

Eventually, because the two of us were so nasty to each other, they moved out of our house and moved in with my grandmother (who amusing is also named Judy). That didn't last long, however, because the two Judy's couldn't stand each other (my grandmother is a hard woman to live with), and they got an apartment of their own, but Judy and my mom were still good friends, so we continued to hang out a lot. Over time, I eventually came to really cherish Meaghan, like a sister I never had, and missed her after we moved away from Michigan.

### You... you can do that?

One boring weekend I was sitting at my dad's house watching an episode of Donahue – at least, I assume it was my dad's, because my grandmother had cable and there's no way I'd be watching day time talk shows when I could be watching Nickelodeon or The Sci-Fi Channel. I'm pretty sure this had to have been in 1991 or 92, which would have made it a rerun, but it could have been when [the episode first aired in 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXvrtBsyCbc). Phil was interviewing this woman, an actress and fashion model, named Caroline Cossey. This woman was _gorgeous_ (and still is), just absolutely stunning. She had this incredible screen presence, a beautiful smile, great hair, and a fantastic body... and according to Phil, had been born male.

This. rocked. my. world. Boys could become girls? What? How... how is that possible? Oh sure, I had seen the tabloids in the grocery store with ridiculous headlines about women who were men, but that was tabloid trash. It sat alongside batboy and alien abduction stories. But this... this was an actual woman who was here talking about growing up as a boy. I was astonished.

I don't remember much more about this revelation, unfortunately. I only remembered this moment after finding the episode on YouTube and suddenly realizing I had seen it before. But this was definitely it, this was the moment that my world moved beneath my feet. This was when I learned the term Transsexual. I started trying to learn more about this, with what little resources I had. This was 2 or more years before I would ever use the internet for the first time, so my options for research were extremely limited. I knew I couldn't tell my mother anything about this interest, so it wasn't possible for me to look it up at the library since I couldn't get there without her (there's a whole other story about the time I did try to go to the library by myself, discovered they had switched to a new library card system, and had a melt-down when they wouldn't let me checkout a book).

In my school district the standard was to start teaching sexual education in the sixth grade. We had a remarkably comprehensive program for the time and place, compared to what I've heard from other people's school age. We were taught about all the major contraceptives, we were taught anatomy, how conception happens, some basics about pregnancy and birth, it was all fairly well covered. I'm not sure if there was anything about non-vaginal sex... probably not, because I didn't learn what a dental dam was until college. Near the end of the unit, our teacher held an anonymous Q & A. The students were allowed to write questions onto pieces of paper and drop them into a hat, and the teacher would pull them out and attempt to answer them. Most kids asked questions about typical sex myths... I asked how she would react if her husband wanted a sex change.

The teacher blanched and sputtered a bit, struggling to know how to answer. As I recall she said that she would still love him but they would probably end up getting divorced, and then quickly moved on to the next question. What freaked me out was that somehow my classmates knew that it was me who asked the question.

### Moving on up

In the winter of 1993-94, after three years of living in "the shack", I woke up in the middle of the night with a startle after a ceiling tile fell on to my bed. The roof of that house was in terrible disrepair and had been leaking very badly all year, and many of the tiles had already fallen after becoming saturated with water. We had buckets all around the room to catch the leaks, which were full of orange colored water from of the fiber glass ceiling insulation. Once they started falling on me, tho, my mother had had enough. A few months later we had moved in to a two bedroom house in town, just 5 blocks from downtown Mount Pleasant. This enabled a whole new way of life for me, since it now meant that I could ride my bike just about anywhere I wanted to go, and could finally stop riding the school bus.

This was a godsend. When you're a bullied kid, school buses are horrors. It is impossible for the driver to keep an eye on what is happening on the bus, and even if they're aware there is just not much they can do while they're driving. Going home from school I could at least make sure I was at the front of the line and get a seat right up by the driver, which saved me a lot of abuse, but when the bus picks you up in the morning you have to sit wherever you can, and that often meant near the back. Additionally, the school bus _always_ made me sick. I have been prone to car sickness my entire life (a trait that apparently is connected to high estrogen), but the buses made it ten times worse because of the diesel fumes, the high center of gravity, and the rigid suspension systems. My ride home, when we lived in the shack, was over an hour long, I was one of the last kids off. I cannot count the number of times I threw up while riding home from school.

Living in town meant we were only a mile from the school. I could ride my bike, and when it become too snowy for that I could just walk. I was free! It also meant I was mere blocks away from many of my favorite parts of town, such as the downtown shops, the island park where the community had built a very large playground (which I participated in construction of), one of the best snow sledding hills in town, the local library, and best of all... my friend Kevin's house.

I had met Kevin earlier in the year; we both rode the same bus home from school, tho he got off much earlier than I did. We both sat in the front two rows of the bus, and he'd spend the entire ride reading Star Trek books. That gave me an in to start talking geek, we bonded during the rides, and when I moved into town we started hanging out together. He was a year older and a grade ahead of me, and significantly more mature, but more importantly, Kevin was a Man's Man. Not toxically masculine, but significantly more masculine than I was, and I learned How To Boy from being around him.

For the next two years we hung out _constantly_. As before, I was still a latch-key kid, so we often would hang out after school, and in the summer we were together most of the day. We would go down to Island Park and play tag on the playground equipment, or cruise around the college campus looking for cans to redeem for cash. One time we discovered that the dollar store had dart guns, so we bought a whole bunch and had a war in my house, over turning furniture for cover. In the winter we'd head over to a tall hill not far from his house that was perfect for sledding, and we'd just slide for hours until we were soaked through and chilled to the bone. Then we'd go back to his house and watched Star Trek episodes while our clothes dried over the radiator. The two of us would ride our bikes over to the Meijer supermarket, snack on free samples, and play games with the loss prevention staff (Two teens alone in the store, they must be stealing something!).

Astonishingly, for two teenage boys, I don't remember us talking about sex much. Yes, we talked about girls; classmates, celebrities, etc... I remember he was incredibly infatuated with Jeri Ryan, an attraction I didn't understand then and still don't really understand now (am I the only one who thinks she was just average looking?). I knew that he wasn't a virgin, and that as a very charming and intelligent man he had a lot of our female classmates interested in him, but he had a very strong sense of honor and didn't like to talk about his sexual exploits.

Kevin had a lot of issues with his mother, and became emancipated at seventeen while I was in tenth grade. He was an all A's student, in spite of regularly skipping classes because he was working a job in order to pay for his apartment. After that we kinda drifted apart, he was too busy to hang out much, and by then I had become obsessed with the Internet. I learned a few years later that he had joined the Navy after high school, which didn't surprise me. Kevin was (and still is) incredibly patriotic and felt a strong urge to serve for his country, and given his Trekker tendencies, the navy was a natural place for him.

### Enter the Internet

My first exposure to the Internet was in seventh grade. The lab that my mom worked in on the college campus had a computer on the campus network, which had the only broadband connection in town. From time to time I'd be allowed on that computer and would surf around on the Gopher ecosystem, reading the various silly articles that propagated within college networks. I remember finding a file full of jokes about Bill Clinton, and laughing my ass off, tho I didn't get some of the jokes.

The world wide web was a toddler at this point, but was on the cusp of turning into a big deal. The university added NCSE Mosaic to their IT infrastructure and I discovered this wonderful hypertext. I found a book at the local library about HTML, and started learning the basics about how to build a webpage.  The book was horrible by todays standards, as this was years before W3C would come to exist, and HTML at the time was like the wild west. The book had no concept of closing tags, and treated paragraph tags like extra tall line breaks.  But, it was enough to teach me how to make my first page. I loaded the file on to a floppy, rode my bike to the university campus to find a computer with Mosaic on it, and saw the page I had written on my grandmother's 486 render on screen.

Within the year the world wide web started to explode. Netscape Navigator came out, introducing the concept of color and rich text formatting to websites, and suddenly web design was a thing. The very first website that I saw with a colored background was Fox's promotional site for the Who Shot Mr. Burns Simpsons cliffhanger, it was colored Simpsons Yellow. I happened upon the website for Sierra Online, the PC games manufacturer, and discovered their webchat. It was remarkably advanced for the time, the one and only web chat I've ever seen that used COMET to deliver conversations in realtime. It was on that webchat that my online personae was born.

Sierra required registering for a nickname with a password. I entered the name Chip, after the protagonist of Disney's Almost Human made for TV movies. The name was taken, so I tacked an "er" on to the end, and Chiper was born. I continued to use that name for the next 22 years.  It was through the Sierra Webchat that I learned of community server maintained by the government of a local township. Anyone who lived in mid-michigan could sign up for an email account and website host, and thus my online presence was forged.  I started learning more and more about building websites, experimenting to find the limits of what I could accomplish in the browsers of the time. Netscape Navigator 2.0 came out and introduced JavaScript, and I was hooked. A programming language that anyone could write in just a normal text editor, without any special software or training? This was the best!

In the fall of 1995 my mom bought us our first modern computer. It was a Power Mac 6200 (technically a Performa 6214), which came with an apple branded Epson printer and a 56k modem. Because my mother was a student (and employee) of the university, we had free access to their dial-up service. Sometimes it was hard to get an open line, and there would be a lot of time spent dialing and re-dialing to just get busy signals, but once I was on I had the entire web at my finger tips... largely unsupervised. I learned four programming languages on that Mac, tinkered with 3D rendering, made online friendships that became real life friendships later on that still persist to this day. That Mac was a gateway to a world of discovery, and I was allowed to be into it, _allowed_ to like it, without any prejudices or judgments. Computers was a thing I enjoyed that people didn't give me a hard time about, and even encouraged, because it was ok for boys to be into computers, especially antisocial loaners who had trouble relating to other people. On the Internet I was normal, or at least as normal as everyone else.

### A Secret Joy

Living in that house in-town brought the opportunity for something else. By this point my mother was both working fulltime and was a fulltime student at the university, so many days I never saw her between breakfast and dinner. That gave me a lot of opportunities to explore a feminine presentation. The house we were in had two bedrooms, but my mother's room had no closets, so instead she kept her dresses and blouses in my closet. Additionally, there were a lot of clothes in my mother's dresser that she could no longer fit into after regaining some of the weight she lost after my parents separated. One of those was a red underwire bra made of stretch charmeuse. I have no idea what size it was, but it fit me quite well. I didn't completely fill the cups, more than you'd probably expect (thanks, gynecomastia!), and a little sock padding took care of the rest. I was 14 years old.

Wearing that bra made me feel so much more whole. I would look down and see breasts that part of me knew should be there. I'd put on one of my t-shirts and stand in front of the bathroom mirror, turning side to side, filled with a sense of warmth that I did not have the words to explain. On days when I knew my mom would be gone for a long time, I would wear that bra for hours as I just did stuff around the house. I would try on my mom's dresses, some of which fit, some of which didn't.

One day I had just gotten into one of her fancier dresses when I heard the front door of our house open. I sprinted across the hallway into the bathroom and closed & locked the door. When she called out my name, I acted like I had just gotten out of the shower as I struggled my way back out of the dress and rolled it up into a towel. I waited until I knew she wasn't in line of site and then ran back into my bedroom in my underwear, stashing the dress behind my bed until I had a chance to put it away.

From the same drawer of clothing too small for her to wear I purloined several other garments. My first pair of leggings in shiny neon blue spandex, a pair of hot pink bike shorts (it was the 90s, neon colors were in), and a one piece swimsuit. I often took to wearing these under my clothes when I would go to school. One day I failed to take the bike shorts off properly while changing in the locker room at school, and one of my bullies spotted them.

> "Do you have pink underwear?"   
> "What? No!"   
> "I saw pink underwear!"   
> "I don't have pink underwear! Why are you looking at my underwear?"

After that I stopped changing in the locker room for PE and took to changing in the bathroom before class. I never felt comfortable changing my clothes around boys, and I was far less likely to be harassed that way.

The piece of clothing that I loved the most, however, was an old nightgown of my mother's. It was a pink satin tank gown, fairly basic, but extremely soft and comfortable. On the rare occasions when she would be out of town, I would wear it to bed. In the winter I could stand over the large heating vent in our livingroom and let it billow out from the air. It made me feel glamorous and powerful. I loved that nightgown, and kept it even after I had gotten rid of all my other clothes. When I was 20 years old my mother happened to find it in my room and threw it away, telling me it wasn't appropriate for me to have it.

<a href="../05.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../05.jpeg" alt="Me riding on my mountain bike in front of our house." class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Summer, 1997, outside our house in the middle of town.</span></a>I kept all these clothes in a bag that I kept hidden in the ceiling in my room. At the time I had a bunk bed, not because I had anyone to sleep on the other bunk, but just because I liked the enclosed space that it gave me. I put curtains across the sides and had mounted things to the sides of the bed. It was like my little fortress of solitude. Having the upper bunk afforded me the opportunity to reach the dropdown ceiling in my bedroom (why the bedroom had a drop ceiling, I do not know). I could lift up one of the tiles and store things in the space above my bed.

I also experimented with makeup a few times. My mother didn't have much makeup, just some powder foundation and lipstick, but I would play with it and see how it felt. I could tell it was something I wanted to know more about, but it just wasn't available to me. Two times my mother caught me, tho she only remembers the first, when she found me with lipstick all over my face. The second time, she could tell I had been into her makeup because it was messy and out of order. She grilled me on why I was getting into it, but I couldn't answer the question. I didn't have an answer to the question. How could I explain that I wanted to wear makeup, when I knew I wasn't allowed to? I told her I had just been curious and was experimenting. She told me not to do it any more, and I stopped.

### Forbidden Wishes

One day, while sitting in my bed, wearing my bra, with a yellow lined notepad in my lap, I wrote a letter to my mother. I don't know exactly when this was, it was probably at the age of 14 or 15, because I'm pretty sure I was in high school at this point, and I think Ace Ventura had recently come out. I cannot remember the exact words of the letter either, but I remember the content. I told her that I hated being a boy, and that I wanted to live as a girl. I told her that I wanted to wear girl's clothes, grow out my hair, be seen as a young woman. I told her that I wanted to have a sex change.

These were the words I knew. This was the language that appeared on tabloids and in daytime talk shows and movies (like the aforementioned Ace Ventura, which was the most awful kind of transphobic representation, but it was what I had). I didn't know hormone therapy existed, I didn't know what transition entailed, I didn't even know the _word_ transition; all I knew was that medical science could turn me into a girl, and I wanted it. I wanted it with every fiber of my existence. I wanted to be pretty, I wanted to wear dresses, I wanted to have breasts and a butt, hips and a waist. I wanted to enjoy fashion, have sleep overs with girl friends, go shopping and dance. I didn't want to date guys, I had no attraction to boys, but I wanted to be romanced and courted, receive flowers and be pampered. I wanted people to praise me for being beautiful, not for being handsome.

All these things I felt in my heart, but had no language to express them, so instead I left the letter at that. I folded the letter into thirds and sealed it into an envelope, on which I wrote "To Mom"... and then I put the envelope into a box in the ceiling, and never opened it again.

### Lost Hope

Trying to learn anything about transness in the mid 90s was extremely difficult. There was limited information available at my public library, and searching the Internet was like wandering through a room blind. The first major search engines on the scene were WebCrawler, Lycos and AltaVista, but they all worked based on frequency of words on the page, not any kind of page ranking, so the results were extremely easy to pollute and finding actual information was next to impossible through all the porn. What I did find... wasn't very comforting.

The majority of early trans Internet spaces [were difficult to find](https://gizmodo.com/an-oral-history-of-the-early-trans-internet-1835702003). They existed in niche corners of the net, in usenet groups, gated web chats, AOL spaces, and secluded IRC channels. If you didn't know how to find them, your odds of stumbling across them were slim. The first trans site that approached any kind of mainstream presence was Susan's Place, which launched in 1996. Unfortunately, Susan's Place did (and still does) largely cater to a specific audience: older white trans women living in the closet, many of whom expressed their gender through cross-dressing and sissy fetishization. Discussions about transition largely centered around the gatekeeping that was present in the medical field, and how you had to be a specific kind of woman to get help. The things that I found through that board did not give me hope for a future as a girl.

It was also at this time that I, unfortunately, learned about the term Autogynephelia (henceforth abbreviated AGP). If you don't know this term, well good, because it's awful. AGP was coined in the 70s by a psychologist named Ray Blanchard. Blanchard created a theory about trans women (and just trans women, he didn't care at all about trans men) that reduced our gender feelings down to an extreme demonstration of sexual orientation. He believes that trans women who are attracted to men were "homosexual men" who felt such a strong attraction to men that they felt the need to look like women in order to attract straight men. Trans women who were attracted to women, however, were "straight men" that fetishized femininity so strongly that they wished to become women themselves. Blanchard's model did not acknowledge the existence of bisexuality. Under Blanchard's dichotomy, any trans woman who is a lesbian is just a fetishist.

Blanchard's system was recognized as a valid explanation for several decades, and it massively affected the available treatment options for trans people. You could not medically transition if doing so meant you would "become" gay. The gay and bisexual men and women who did successfully transition did so by lying to doctors about their feelings abd who they were dating, and by never getting married (not that they could once the state recognized them as legally their gender).

I learned this term from somewhere, I'm not exactly sure, I suspect it may have been my mother's psychology 101 textbook, but it may have also been on the Internet. Either way, I internalized this. I believed that my feelings of wishing to be a woman were purely fetishistic, and as such were not something I should pursue openly. Growing up in the Witness faith had indoctrinated me that fetishes were sinful and disgusting, something I had to suppress... and suppress I did.

At the age of 16, when my mother and I moved away from Mt. Pleasant to Midland, Michigan, entering into 11th grade. I took this as an opportunity to reinvent myself, to cut ties from the feminine boy everyone knew, and embrace my own manhood. I threw away the bra, the clothes, everything I had attached to my womanhood save for that nightgown that I cherished so much. I took the letter that I had written to my mother, which had sat in that box for over a year, and I burned it. In the new town I took on a new personae, I became the young man that was expected of me.

The desires never went away, however, they continued to pester at me, and I had to find an outlet.

### More Than Meets The Eye

The little town that my dad lives in has a tiny library no bigger than a two bedroom house. When we still lived there, my mom would take me there occasionally to check out kids books. There was one book that I became obsessed with, it was called [Balloonia](https://www.amazon.com/Balloonia-Childs-Play-Library-Audrey/dp/1904550495). The story is about a little girl named Jessica whose brother tells her about a magical land where all balloons go when they're let go. The girl demands to be taken there, and her balloon obliges her, turning Jessica herself into a balloon. The book is a classic be-careful-what-you-wish-for type story designed to teach children not to be bratty or else they'll get what they deserve. The book had a much more significant affect on me, however. It triggered a feeling in me that I couldn't understand or explain. I wanted to be that little girl; I wanted to transform.

That feeling came to me again one night when I was at my grandmother's house. For most of my teen years she lived in an attached townhouse with a second floor and a full basement. She kept her television and her computer in the basement, so I spent many hours down there. One night I'm watching the Tales from the Darkside film (god do I ever miss the old SciFi Channel), alone and completely unbeknown to my grandmother.  The fourth segment of the film is titled Lover's Vow, and is about a man who is mugged in an alleyway and gets saved by this grotesque creature. The creature makes him promise a vow that he would never tell anyone about what he saw that night, and in return he would be brought good fortune. He promises, and as he is returning home from the scene he runs into a young woman on the street. The two of them fall in love, and from then on his life keeps getting better and better as he builds a career as an artist. They get married, have kids, everything is going great for him, but he can't stop thinking about this creature that he saw. He starts sketching it, compulsively, filling his drawing room with images of it. His wife gets worried, as this is clearly turning into an obsession. He breaks down and tells her the story. She starts crying, and then turns around and shouts "YOU PROMISSED YOU'D NEVER TELL!!".

What followed is one of the most gruesome transformation sequences I've ever seen, in fact I suspect it was probably edited when I saw it because the original sequence is far too gross for even cable television. I don't recommend going looking for it, you'll probably come away thinking I'm highly disturbed for what you see. The wife and their kids all turn into gargoyles, she takes the children, flies away to a rooftop, and they all turn to stone.

In the midst of the transformation, I orgasmed. I cannot explain it, and part of me is very disturbed with myself for it, but it happened all the same. Sitting there in the dark on my grandmothers floor, that sequence tapped deep down into a part of me that really, *really* wanted to metamorphosis, and it triggered an explosion of euphoria.  I didn't even touch myself, I just suddenly had very wet underwear. I got up and went over to her laundry space and used some paper towels to clean myself up as best as I could, and felt *extremely* embarrassed.

Thus began my divisive relationship with transformation pornography.

Initially there wasn't much fodder for this. This was before we had internet at home, so my only opportunities to explore this were through mainstream films. American Werewolf in London, the Species series, the pig scene in Willow, various transformations in The Witches...  However, once we had internet in our own house, I discovered the wonderful world of usenet porn, and `alt.binaries.multimedia.transformation`. Here was a treasure trove of images, mostly hand drawn, depicting transformation sequences of all sorts, as well as video clips from various films. Clearly, I was not the only person on the internet with this obsession.

Back then the vast majority of this content came from hentai, but that which wasn't (in what will be no surprise to many people, I'm sure), came from furry fandom, a subculture I never became invested in myself, but was very familiar with.  In 2000, DeviantArt launched, and furry culture exploded online, and with that came a massive surge in fetish/kink material. Suddenly there was a central place for the creators of this content to distribute it, where fans could not only find it and share, but could *pay* for it via commissions. In 2004, DeviantArt instituted a new adult content policy which explicitly banned pornographic imagery, pushing a lot of those people over to sites that were less strict. Most of the furry community moved to FurAffinity, and many artists launched their own websites, but eventually this gave rise to the king of them all... Tumblr.

Oh Tumblr, how the mighty have fallen. From around 2010 forward, Tumblr was my primary source of pornographic content, of all kinds. No matter what particular kink you were in to, you could find it on Tumblr, and it was one of the few services full of porn that had an iPhone app. When Yahoo bought Tumblr in 2013, the company started cracking down on adult content on the site, largely because advertisers don't like having their products shown alongside hardcore porn, but the efforts were minimalist. Posts and accounts could get taken down for being reported, but mostly the system kept running. Finally, in 2018, Yahoo completely banned all nudity from the site, even artistic expression, and employed an automated system to detect it. Within a month, everyone had fled the platform.
