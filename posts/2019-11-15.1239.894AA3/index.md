Wednesday we packed the kids and drove up to Anaheim for a day at Disneyland. If you saw my IG stories then most of these photos are probably repeats.

I found these two simply gorgeous dresses in New Orleans Square that they actually had all the way up to 4X, and had they been around $70 I would have bought one, but $130 was too much, even when we weren’t paying for the trip. The first was Hocus Pocus themed, with the Sanderson Sisters prominently featured on the skirt. The second was Pixar themed, with elements from early Pixar shorts.

This was our first visit to the new Star Wars park, and it was truly an amazing experience. From the moment you cross under the disney railroad bridge you enter into an alien world, but switch is so subtle that you don’t even notice it until you’re 20 feet in. The sounds, the smells, the shape of the terrain and vegetation, even the light posts gradually change into something not of this world. It’s astonishingly atmospheric. Then you enter the bazaar and it’s just a trip, everything feels so authentic, save for the legally mandated universal signage.

Sadly, we weren’t able to walk up to the Millennium Falcon because there was a film crew setting up across the park to film what we assume was a music video (there was a stage full of instruments in front of the Falcon). The new ride was also a 40 minute wait, so we weren’t gonna try to do that with the kids, either.

Christmas is my favorite time to visit the park, and I’m so glad we got to go this month. At night the park is even more lit up than usual, with christmas lights all over the place, and the entire castle becomes aglow with snowy glitter.

What I loved the most, however, is just how freaking queer Disneyland is these days! So many same sex couples holding hands, trans peeps living large (both guests and cast members), people flagging their pride colors, it was awesome. Disneyland is the safest place in the country to be LGBT, and it’s beautiful.
