Left was one month into HRT. Right is 31 months.

I feel like these photos don’t do justice to just how much my hands have shrank. I used to be able to hold my wife’s fist inside mine, my fingers were easily 2cm longer than hers, and now they’re equal length. I used to wear 13 ring size, and now I wear a 9.5.

My fingernails lost half a millimeter in thickness, and my skin is significantly less chapped and broken.

I never anticipated just how much of a difference HRT would have on my hands.
