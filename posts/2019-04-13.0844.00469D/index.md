Do you ever take a photo where you think you’re smiling, and then look at it and realize it’s more of a grimace? I don’t know why I look so pensive in all these pics...

My Elomi Sachi bra broke a little over a week ago and I thought for sure it was a loss, but this morning I realized I could probably stitch it back together pretty easily. It worked, and I'm so glad, it’s pretty much perfect for this dress.
