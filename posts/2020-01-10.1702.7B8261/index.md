This thread was a journey. Initially I started capturing this on the base message, but then I saw the replies and it took a whole new depth.

Women, stop doing this to your sisters and your daughters, be they cis or trans! Take it from a girl who had to fight for it, womanhood is a blessing!

Yes, misogyny and patriarchy sucks, but that burden is a product of forces outside of womanhood itself. Lay the blame where it is due. That discrimination is not worthy of normalization. When you come down with the flu, you don’t say “welcome to humanity.” Treat that garbage for the plague it is.

Yes, periods suck, mood swings suck, cramps brutally suck, bleeding out every month FUCKING SUCKS, but it is also a gift of life (infertility conditions aside). A gift that many of your trans sisters would happily endure for the miracle it allows. Your daughters don't have to cherish it, but they shouldn't be told it's a curse either. Hearing other women be so negative about this aspect of their bodies sets young women up to hate themselves and feel like they’ve been dealt a bad hand simply because they happened to be female. Then when that same negativity gets handed to trans women, dare I say most of whom would happily endure that pain for the ability to bear children, it’s an even harsher blow.

The takeaway here should not be “this is ok to do because cis women get it too,” it should be “this is an awful thing to say to any woman.”
