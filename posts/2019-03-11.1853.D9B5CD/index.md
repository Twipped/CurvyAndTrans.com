About a year ago Kat found this wonderful product on Amazon that has saved us both so much pain. This isn't a paid endorsement, I just really love this product. It's a bamboo fabric liner that sits between your underwire and your skin, wicking away moisture and distributing the pressure of the wire so it doesn't dig in and leave red marks. When we went to Disneyland back in January I wore my pushup bra all day long, completely comfortably because of this marvelous strip of fabric, and they cost so little. It's machine washable and comes in three colors.
