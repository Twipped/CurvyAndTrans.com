### A New Home


{!{
  {{import '~/img' images['1'] className="card right span4" alt="My mom and I sitting with our two dogs in front of a brown wall, grass around our feet." caption="Spring 1992"}}
}!}

With assistance from my grandfather, the money she had in savings, and the meager income from working as a cashier, my mother started taking classes at Central Michigan University with the goal of getting the basic education she needed to find better work.

In the mean time, the two of us lived in a small house on the outskirts of town which we rented for a measly $100 per month. It was actually a pretty large home for the two of us, probably about 1500 square feet. Three bedrooms, huge livingroom, and a reasonably sized kitchen. It also had a pretty large yard, and the forest behind it backed up to the river. Unfortunately, the reason the house was so cheap was because it was a shithole. It was built on a flood plane, and despite sitting on a four elevated rise, it still had flooded several times since its construction. You could see on the walls where the water level had been.

I can remember every detail of this house, from forest green carpet throughout and the beige linoleum in the kitchen, to the speckled ceiling tiles in the bedrooms. The livingroom had a huge vaulted ceiling with two skylights in it, but the skylights were perpetually covered in leaves from all the trees around the house. The only heating was from a gas space heater in the livingroom, so we used small cube heaters in our bedrooms. The livingroom walls had that wood paneling that was so common in the 70s and 80s. The entire house stank of mildew and probably had a ton of mold in the walls.

In the beginning we had no furniture. My mother slept on an air mattress on the floor, and I slept on a camping cot. Eventually we obtained some essentials; beds, a used love seat, the table and chairs from my father's house. No television, however; my mother was adamant that we would have no "idiot box" in her home. My only source of entertainment was what books I could get from the library, my legos, and a handful of board games. Eventually we bought a stereo, so I would often have one of the local rock music stations playing during the day.

The house water supply was fed by a well in the front yard that, regrettably, was contaminated with sulfur, bad enough that you could smell it when you turned on the water. It was not drinkable, and tho we would occasionally shower in it if we were desperate, we tried not to get our hair wet. Not that you could take much of a shower, because the siphon pump that drew from the well was so poor that there was almost no water pressure. I took baths at my grandmothers house, and my mom would wash at the gym. It didn't have a clothes washer either, of course, so my mom and I went to the laundromat every week.

The refrigerator didn't work when we first moved in to the house, so for the first six months my mom would give me fifty cents every morning to run across the street to a convenience store and buy a pint of milk to use for my cereal. Eventually the owner of the home got the fridge repaired, but something was clearly wrong with it, because if I touched the fridge and the sink at the same time I could feel AC current passing through my body.

Behind the house was a fenced off space that at one time had been a dog run, but was just piled full of trash from previous tenants. For the first year we didn't touch it, and instead built a new covered dog run further out in the yard. At night it was my job to go out there and let the dogs back into the house, but there was very little light behind the house and I was afraid of the dark woods, so every time I would run as fast as I possibly could out to the dog cage, flip open the latch, and then run back to the house with the dogs alongside.

At one point my mother got the idea that we should raise some chickens again, and she got a dozen baby chicks. We laid down newspaper in the back wetroom and setup heat lamps. When the chickens got too large to keep in that room, we finally cleared out the garbage from behind the house, repaired the fence, and built a small roosting house so the space could become a chicken run. I don't remember what ever happened to those chickens...

Of course, now that my mom was working full time to support us while also going to school full time, that meant that I couldn't be home schooled any more, and that's when things really started to suck.

### The Feminine Boy

{!{
  {{import '~/img' images['2'] className="card right span4" alt="Me and a group of other girls around my age." caption="Wheatland Music Festival, 1991"}}
}!}

Growing up home-schooled in the JW faith meant spending a lot of time in the door-to-door field service work. The women of the faith, especially those who were home-makers (and really, back then that was most of them), were expected to be in the field service work for most of the week, and certainly on weekends. I, of course, went with her, and that meant that most of my time was spent around women. Because of this, I think my mother never really noticed how many feminine traits I was exhibiting as a child, or if she did she assumed I was just emulating the women around me. Unfortunately she refuses to acknowledge any of these traits, even the ones I remember, and claims that she doesn't "believe" in gendered behavior.

I entered public school for the first time in fourth grade. I was a tremendously awkward child, in no small part because the only socialization I had received was within the JW organization. I related to most of the world via bible stories, and would reference those on a regular basis. I was also still very sensitive to negative responses from other kids, and wow were non-witness kids mean. I was a bit of a teacher's pet and constantly was interrupting class to ask questions and make comments, which drew a lot of ire from my classmates. It wasn't long into my first year before the bullying started, and the bullies drilled right in on how feminine I was. My manner of speak, the way I moved, my responses, my interests, the fact that I cried so much. That's when the gay slurs started getting hurled, words I had never heard before.

I looked these words up and found myself scratching my head. Of course, growing up in a strictly conservative religious environment, the only thing I knew about sex was that you didn't do it with someone you weren't married to, and why would a boy marry a boy? Why would they think I was attracted to boys? I had barely even heard of someone being gay, and only in the context of it being a sin. I hadn't hit puberty yet, I didn't even know what sexual attraction was, and I certainly wouldn't be interested in boys.  Boys had _always_ been mean to me, always caused fights and acted cruel. Even among the witness kids, the boys just never liked playing with me.

One day the principal came to our classroom and took me out of class. She walked me back to her office and sat me down at the little table in the lobby of the school. She sat down opposite me, and asked if it was true that I had brought a condom to school. I was nine years old, I didn't even know what a condom *was*, so I asked. She, of course, blustered and said it was something adults use during sex. I stared back at her, blankly, and said "What's sex?" At this point she was, of course, walking a very dangerous line, so she called my mother.

When my mom arrived at the school half an hour later, the principal explained to her that some of the other students claimed I had been playing with a condom, showing it off to other kids. My mother asked "Well what does he say?"

"He says he doesn't know what that is," she replied.

"Of course he doesn't, he's nine."

"Uhm... well..."

"You called me out of work because a bully lied to you about my son and you refused to believe him?"

The matter was dropped, but the bullying only continued to escalate.

One day while on the way from my fifth grade classroom to the elementary school gymnasium, two boys grabbed me and shoved me into the girls bathroom, yelling out "that's where you belong, faggot!" I can remember every detail of that bathroom, so clearly that I could draw a picture of it. The truth was, part of me knew that they were right. I did belong in that bathroom, but it wasn't a place I was allowed to be, so I grew terrified of the trouble I would get into for being there.

The few boys who were nice to me soon distanced themselves because they would also get made fun of just for associating with "the gay kid". The girls weren't any help either, as they avoided me purely on principle for being a boy. Once while I was on the playground, one of my bullies ran up behind me and pulled down my shorts and underwear. They wanted to see if I actually had a penis. They knew what I was just starting to figure out. I wasn't actually a boy.

Then came puberty.

### Depersonalization

I hated my life, I hated my body, I despised my classmates. You might be inclined to say "Oh, so does every teenager," but no, this was much deeper than typical teen angst. In my fifth grade yearbook I drew crosses over the faces of the children who hurt me the most, but no photo was defaced any where near as much as my own. I scratched it out so hard that I dug through the paper and made a hole. I _loathed_ my face, in photos, in reflections, everywhere. Every time I saw my own body I was wracked with pain and anguish. Of course, everyone would just say "Oh, nobody likes what they look like in photos," but it was so much more than that. That face was not mine, it couldn't be mine. I didn't know why it couldn't be mine, but it wasn't.

The JW Kingdom Hall in Mount Pleasant had a very large mirror on the wall in the mudroom (aka, entry coat room for those of you who didn't grow up in inclimate weather regions). Sometimes when I was bored during the program I would go to the bathroom and then duck in to there there and just stare at that mirror, seething with hatred. Who was this boy? Who was this ugly person staring back at me?

From the age of 12 to 15 me and several of the boys in our JW congregation would go on a weekend trip to Ludington State Park, on Lake Michigan. One of the dads owned a camping trailer that he pulled with a giant conversion van. We'd all load up and spend two nights in the Cedar campground, cooking over the fire pit and riding our bikes on the forest trails or hiking along the beach dunes. At night we would play hide and seek in the woods next to our campsite. These trips were already pretty hard because while these kids were the closest thing I had to friends, I still wasn't one of them. We hung out because we had no one else to hang out with, friendships forced by common faith. One year they brought a camcorder with them and recorded this group of motley teen boys during their shenanigans. When I saw the video of myself, it filled me with dread. Something deep inside my brain said "that's not you" and it horrified me.

There is [an episode of Star Trek TNG](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Clues_(episode)) where the Enterprise crew wakes up after having lost a bunch of time and finds a bunch of clues that just don't add up. At one point in the episode Deanna Troi is in her quarters, goes to the bathroom, and screams.

> The mirror... I came in here...   
> and I looked into the mirror...   
> It wasn't me, Worf... Not me...   
> It was my face, but it wasn't me inside...   

It was kinda like that.

I became depressed, deeply depressed, and despondent. I started having suicidal ideation at 11 years old. I submitted an essay for a school writing project titled "Five reasons I want to kill myself". I don't even remember this, my mother told me about it the day I came out to her as trans. The school staff rightfully became extremely concerned, and my mother was forced to put me into therapy immediately (much to her chagrin; JWs don't believe in psychotherapy). I was put on anti-depressants, which made me feel even stranger and didn't actually make me happier.

Eventually my mother asked me "Do you feel like these drugs are making a difference?"

I replied "I can't really tell."

"Do you feel like the psychiatrist is helping?" she asked?

"Mom, that man is crazier than I am."

Eventually my mother put her foot down and took me off the medications, because it just wasn't working. SSRIs never do work for gender dysphoria, it isn't caused by a lack of serotonin, it's hormonal. My brain was flush with testosterone and severely depleted of estrogen. It was screaming in agony.

### Eating Away the Pain

What did work for me was eating. I discovered I could eat my feelings away. Granted, we were poor, so there wasn't a lot of food _to_ eat, but I found my ways. Between the age of 9 and 11 I exploded into childhood obesity.

{!{
  {{import '~/img' images['4'] className="card center" alt="Photos, age 7 to 13" caption=""}}
}!}

After my parents separated I spent every weekend either at my Grandma's house, or at my Dad's. Part of this was out of tedium, because my mom's house was just so boring. Our house was too far out of town for me to walk to anything, and since it was right on a main highway into town and there were no sidewalks, it was far too dangerous for me to ride my bike. I hated that house, especially once the kids at school decided that we were living in a rotted shack. From the street you could only see a tiny portion of the house, which was old & water logged.

Every weekday I would ride the bus home from school, let myself into the house, and then would be alone for 3-4 hours until my mom got home. Nothing to do but listen to the radio and make-believe (I didn't even have many books), so basically I just sat around the house and ate food. Initially it was simpler stuff, mac & cheese, peanut butter sandwiches, ramen... whatever we had on hand that a 10-11 year old could make without burning down the house. Cereal, oh so much cereal, both hot and cold.

Weekends at my grandmas meant I could pig out on all sorts of bad food. Cookies, bagels, chips, crackers, juice... Grandma's house was always full of carbs.  At my dads... well usually I'd be pretty hungry at my dad's because the man could barely feed himself, much less have food around for a tween. Meals typically consisted of venison steaks or burgers, or I'd have a bowl of corn flakes. What he would have a lot of, though, was ice cream. He bought it in ten gallon containers from Schwans, or would get big boxes of Drumstick pre-made cones. If we went in to town I could usually convince him to stop at a gas station and buy me a soda and a candy bar. He also had a lot of loose change laying around, he collected it in big plastic buckets. I would sort out the change, roll it, and then walk or ride my bike in to town to exchange the rolls for food from the convenience store (usually candy and soda). He got very angry when he discovered I was doing this, he said I was stealing from him (cuz that's a thing an 11 year old can do to their parent), but it didn't stop me. I just got more circumspect with it.

Because of our income status my mom qualified for assisted living, which meant I got free school lunches. In elementary school the meals were pretty well calorie managed, but I'd eat all of it. Once I got into middle school, however, jackpot. The main entree was of course always a fixed portion, but the salad bar was all you could fit on to your tray, and I could fit a lot. I would make massive salads piled high with all sorts of stuff, drown it in dressing, and then chow down.

My mother was very disturbed by how much weight I was putting on and kept trying to make me diet. She'd frequently nag me about my over eating and would tell me that if I didn't take care of my body now, I would deeply regret it when I was older. I didn't care; whatever happened to this sack of meat and bones that hosted the symbiote called my brain was immaterial. That's all I could perceive my body as, a device to serve a purpose of keeping me alive and relocating me from point A to point B. I had no love for my flesh, and no concern for its well being.

My mom was constantly encouraging me to be more physically active, but was fairly powerless to do anything about it. She would take me to the university rec center and try to encourage me to run around the track. She kept telling me "It will make you feel better, the endorphins will kick in and you'll feel good." Never once in my life did physical exercise make me feel better, and as I got older it made me feel significantly worse. Today I know that this is because I had Inattentive ADHD, but back then it was believed that boys only got Hyperactive ADHD, which I didn't have the symptoms for. It wasn't until I was in college that I started to suspect I had ADHD, but my mother firmly denied it and gaslit me on it until I stopped pressing it. It wasn't until my thirties when I saw a list of ADHD symptoms and realized they all applied to me that I sought out a diagnoses.

When encouragement didn't work, my mom resorted to bribes, paying me to walk from my school to a meeting place on the college campus. I earned two dollars per day, which was added to a tin can at my grandmother's house, saving up to purchase a GameBoy (which I successfully did, after my grandmother matched my contribution half way). I actually didn't mind the walks so much, especially in the winter when there was snow on the ground.  Oh sure, I resented having to walk in the cold and the wet, but I found fun places along the way that made for entertaining diversions. A huge pine tree that turned into an igloo when the branches were weighted down with snow, for example. Various places where the snow plows would dump their loads, creating massive snow mountains to climb or dig into the side of. Streaks of black ice that I could "skate" across in my snow boots. The worst part was that by the time I'd be at the rec center to meet her, I'd be in quite a bit of discomfort.

Around the seventh grade I started to experience a dull throbbing pain in my groin any time I would perform any kind of intense physical activity, especially anything that required running. The more I ran, the more it hurt. It wasn't an intense pain, I could work through it, but it would make it extremely hard to keep running. I was always the last person to finish the mile run in P.E. because inevitably I would have to start walking because of the pain. I of course told my mom and my P.E. teachers that I was having this, but nobody could think of a reason why it would be happening, and since I was fat they just dismissed it as being obesity related. Sometimes I got the feeling they didn't believe I was in any pain at all, just faking it to get out of having the exercise. My classmates thought this as well, and it contributed further to my status as a pariah.

I regularly went to doctors visits, we had health insurance through my father, and my mother remembers me complaining about the pain, but no one could produce a diagnoses. There was no obvious evidence for why I was in so much pain, so I was forced to just continue to live with it. Eventually I stopped telling anyone about it, because the answer was always the same: Lose Weight.

It wasn't until I was 26 years old that I learned about a testicular torsion when one of my co-workers' son had to have his corrected. If you aren't familier with this condition, it occurs when a developmental abnormality causes the spermatic cord of a testical to become twisted. This cuts off blood flow to the testicle, severely damaging it. By the time I knew what was happening, the damage was far too gone. My left testicle was destroyed, mangled and beaten from years of being choked to death by its own arteries.

### I don't have to be a boy?

That fateful day, a boring weekend at my dad's house watching the only thing available to watch because he didn't have cable, I sat there watching Donahue and learned about Caroline Cossey, actress and super model, who had been born male. Caroline was (and still is) _gorgeous_, just absolutely stunning. She had this incredible screen presence that captivated you, a beautiful smile, amazing hair, and a fantastic body. [The episode is on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXvrtBsyCbc) (uploaded by Caroline herself) and is remarkable respectful by 1990 standards. Phil did everything he could to treat her with dignity.

This. rocked. my. world. Boys could become girls? What? How... how is that possible? Oh sure, I had seen the tabloids in the grocery store with ridiculous headlines about women who were men, but that was tabloid trash. It sat alongside batboy and alien abduction stories. But this... this was an actual woman who was here talking about growing up as a boy. I was astonished. Then my father walked in, saw what I was watching, proclaimed it to be disgusting, and turned the television off. This was my first real exposure to trans people, and I knew immediately that it was something detestable in my parents eyes.

It was at this moment that I began to actively want to change my gender identity. I started thinking a lot more about how badly I wanted to be a girl, started longing even stronger to be able to dress like a girl and be more involved in feminine things, but I still didn't think of myself as being a girl. There was no language to say that if you want this, that means you are actually female. Even the concept of "being transgender" was never presented to me, and you weren't a transsexual until you went through the process, until you had surgery. Trans wasn't something you were, it's something you did. At no point did anyone ever tell me that my wants meant I already was a girl, but the feeling began to express itself all the same.

Policy in Mount Pleasant School District was to conduct scoliosis screenings on all children during the fifth grade. When this time came around, all of the children in my school's three fifth grade classes were told to line up in the hallway, boys on the left, girls on the right. Boys were sent to one classroom and girls were sent to another. I remember standing in the boys line and thinking to myself that I was in the wrong line. I knew that this was the line I was *supposed* to be standing in, but it wasn't the line I *belonged* in.

Sexual education in my school district began in the sixth grade. Unlike what most people seem to have experienced, our sex-ed was not segregated, all the kids were taught together. We had a remarkably comprehensive program for the time and place, compared to what I've heard from other people. We were taught about all the major contraceptives, we were taught anatomy, how conception happens, some basics about pregnancy and birth, it was all fairly well covered. I'm quite certain there was nothing about non-vaginal sex, because I didn't learn what a dental dam was until college, but all the important elements of PiV were addressed.

Near the end of the unit, our teacher held an anonymous Q & A. The students were allowed to write questions onto pieces of paper and drop them into a hat, and the teacher would pull them out and attempt to answer them. Most kids asked questions about typical sex myths, like if it was true a girl could avoid pregnancy by being on top. I asked how my teacher would react if her husband wanted a sex change.

She blanched and sputtered a bit, struggling to know how to answer. As I recall she said that she would still love him but they would probably end up getting divorced, and then she quickly moved on to the next question. What freaked me out was that somehow several of my classmates knew that it was me who asked the question, and turned to stare at me.

### Moving on up

In the winter of 1993-94, after three years of living in "the shack", I woke up in the middle of the night with a startle after a ceiling tile fell on to my bed. The roof of that house was in terrible disrepair and had been leaking very badly all year, and many of the tiles had already fallen after becoming saturated with water. We had buckets all around the room to catch the leaks, which were full of orange colored water from of the fiber glass ceiling insulation. Once they started falling on me, tho, my mother had had enough. A few months later we had moved in to a two bedroom house in town, just 5 blocks from downtown Mount Pleasant. This enabled a whole new way of life for me, since it now meant that I could ride my bike just about anywhere I wanted to go, and could finally stop riding the school bus.

This was a godsend. When you're a bullied kid, school buses are horrors. It is impossible for the driver to keep an eye on what is happening on the bus, and even if they're aware there is just not much they can do while they're driving. Going home from school I could at least make sure I was at the front of the line and get a seat right up by the driver, which saved me a lot of abuse, but when the bus picks you up in the morning you have to sit wherever you can, and that often meant near the back.

Additionally, the school bus _always_ made me sick. I have been prone to car sickness my entire life (a trait that I have since learned is connected to high estrogen), but the buses made it ten times worse because of the diesel fumes, the high center of gravity, and the rigid suspension systems. My ride home when we lived in the shack was over an hour long, I was the last kid off. I cannot count the number of times I threw up while riding home from school. Once, upon realizing that the bus I was on didn't have a trash can, I lept up to an open window and stuck me head out before letting go. The vomit sprayed all the way down the side of the moving bus, pressed against it by the passing wind. The driver told me the next day that she had to power wash it off after she got back to the garage.

Living in town meant that we were only a mile from the school. I could ride my bike, and when it become too snowy for that I could just walk. I was free! It also meant I was mere blocks away from many of my favorite parts of town, such as the downtown shops, the island park where the community had built a very large playground (which I participated in construction of), one of the best snow sledding hills in town, the local library, and best of all... my friend Kevin's house.

I had met Kevin earlier in the year; we both rode the same bus home from school, tho he got off much earlier than I did. We both sat in the front two rows of the bus, and he'd spend the entire ride reading Star Trek books. That gave me an in to start talking geek, we bonded during the rides, and when I moved into town we started hanging out together. He was a year older and a grade ahead of me, and significantly more mature, but more importantly, Kevin was a Man's Man. Not toxically masculine, but significantly more masculine than I was, and I learned How To Boy from being around him.

For the next two years we hung out _constantly_. As before, I was still a latch-key kid, so we often would hang out after school, and in the summer we were together most of the day. We would go down to Island Park and play tag on the playground equipment, or cruise around the college campus looking for soda cans to redeem for cash. One time we discovered that the dollar store had dart guns, so we bought a whole bunch and had a war in my house, over turning furniture for cover. In the winter we'd head over to a tall hill not far from his house that was perfect for sledding, and we'd just slide for hours until we were soaked through and chilled to the bone. Then we'd go back to his house and watched Star Trek episodes while our clothes dried over the radiator. The two of us would ride our bikes over to the Meijer supermarket, snack on free samples, and play games with the loss prevention staff (Two teens alone in the store, they must be stealing something!).

Astonishingly, for two teenagers, I don't remember us talking about sex much. Yes, we talked about girls; classmates, celebrities, etc... I remember he was incredibly infatuated with Jeri Ryan, an attraction I didn't understand then and still don't really understand now (am I the only one who thinks Seven of Nine was just average looking?). I knew that he wasn't a virgin, and that as a very charming and intelligent man he had a lot of our female classmates interested in him, but he had a very strong sense of honor and didn't like to talk about his sexual exploits.

Kevin had a lot of issues with his mother, and became emancipated at seventeen while I was in tenth grade. He was an all A's student, in spite of regularly skipping classes because he was working a job in order to pay for his apartment. After that we kinda drifted apart, he was too busy to hang out much, and by then I had become obsessed with the Internet. I learned a few years later that he had joined the Navy after high school, which didn't surprise me. Kevin was (and still is) incredibly patriotic and felt a strong urge to serve for his country, and given his Trekker tendencies, the navy was a natural place for him.
