Sir Terry Pratchett on the subject of both-sides-ism and discrimination:

> “Well, there are two sides to every question…”
>
> “What do you do when one of ‘em’s wrong?” The reply came back like an arrow.
>
> “I meant that we are enjoined to see things from the other person’s point of view,” said Oats, patiently.
>
> “You mean that from the point of view of a torturer, torture is all right?”

> "There is a very interesting debate raging at the moment about the nature of sin, for example,” said Oats.
>
> “And what do they think? Against it, are they?” said Granny Weatherwax.
>
> “It’s not as simple as that. It’s not a black and white issue. There are so many shades of gray.”
>
> “Nope.”
>
> “Pardon?”
>
> “There’s no grays, only white that’s got grubby. I’m surprised you don’t know that. And sin, young man, is when you treat people as things. Including yourself. That’s what sin is.
>
> “It’s a lot more complicated than that–”
>
> “No. It ain’t. When people say things are a lot more complicated than that, they means they’re getting worried that they won’t like the truth. People as things, that’s where it starts.”
>
> “Oh, I’m sure there are worse crimes–”
>
> “But they starts with thinking about people as things …”
