This is my “We have company coming, clean all the things!” outfit 😆

I have such an incredible love now for short shorts. For years it was always knee length basketball shorts or cargo shorts. I had one pair of Puritan (old walmart brand) elastic waist khaki shorts that I wore so much that they fell apart. I never imagined the sheer joy that would come from wearing midi shorts.

Unfortunately I can’t wear these shorts outside of the house, as they’re *so* short that my underwear hangs out the back, a fact my wife reminds me of every time I wear them. 😛
