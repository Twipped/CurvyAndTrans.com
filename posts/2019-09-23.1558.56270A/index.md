Put this look together yesterday for my daughterâ€™s seventh birthday. We are so beyond done with hosting birthday parties ourselves, so this year we had it with a local Pump-It-Up. If you donâ€™t know this place, itâ€™s a chain where they have a bunch of large inflatable bounce house type things setup in several rooms, so the kids get to run around and burn all their energy before getting lunch in a side room.

Last image is a video in my stories yesterday of me climbing one and not so graceful sliding down while trying to keep my skirt around my legs. ðŸ˜†

In other news, I launched a total redesign of my website over the weekend, moving away from the giant wall-o-my-face that the old landing page suffered from, and trying to emphasize the text content more.

I have three new posts in the draft queue that comprise the first parts of my memoir. Itâ€™s a lot of text (>13k words in total), so if anyone is willing to provide editorial assistance, DM me and Iâ€™ll send you the urls.
