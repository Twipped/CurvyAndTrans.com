Kimonos make every outfit instantly better. Feeling very gender euphoric today.

I accidentally used way to much of my cicapair concealer cream this morning but didnâ€™t have time for contour, so now my face looks pale as hell.

Dress was a Ross find and is made by [Vibe Apparel](https://www.vibeapparelco.com/plus-size/shop-by-category-new/dresses/) (although this pattern doesn't seem to be available any more), who have a TON of really cute plus size dresses for great prices, and [can also be found on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Vibe-Sportswear/node/11793009011/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll2&tag=curvyandtrans-20&linkId=bfbfe6fba8c3c0e6fac3456607911a39&language=en_US).
