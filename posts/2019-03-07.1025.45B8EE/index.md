I’ve now done over 130 injections of this glorious liquid... and yet it’s still something of a ritual every time. I still have to psych myself up before the needle touches my skin. Usually I don’t even feel it, but the anticipation of pain always makes me pause. By the time I’m 60 I’ll have done over 1600 of these shots, assuming I stay at the same frequency for the next twenty years. I don’t plan to stop at sixty either, I intend to continue to take this drug until I’m physically unable to continue it.

The way I see it, I already had 28 years of menopause, I see no reason to do it again.
