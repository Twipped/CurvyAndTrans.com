Slightly different Transformation Tuesday post from my usual. Left was taken Sunday night right before my wife set to work coloring my hair. Right was taken just now after getting back from my brow appointment.

I made this not just to show the color and brow differences, but also how starkly different I look in makeup vs out. Iâ€™m not even wearing foundation, just a few primers and some BB cream, plus some eyeliner.
