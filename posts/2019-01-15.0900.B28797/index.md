It’s been kind of a lazy Tuesday. My wife is off running errands, leaving me the chance to do a photoshoot. Got a whole bunch of great shots, tho some of them are probably too racy for Instagram.

I got a worm in my brain this morning that I feel like writing about. Many of the women I follow here on IG have posted about receiving awful messages in regards to their weight. Fatphobia is rampant on IG, we all know this... yet someone I’ve yet to be hit by it, and it leaves me wondering why.

Is it because I’m trans? Granted, I also haven’t gotten much transphobia either, but still, do the assholes who plague everyone else write me off because I’m AMAB?

Is it my hashtags? Am I just not posting under tags these trolls search in?

Is it just that they’re prettier than me? So much of that troll energy is the result of cognitive dissonance within attraction. Am I just not hot enough to kick off that hate? This applies to the transphobia as well, am I in the comfortable middle ground of passing enough to not trigger “man-in-a-dress” mode, but not hot enough to trigger toxic masculinity?

Am I too old? Does nobody care that a 38 year old woman is fat?

Or is this just a critical mass thing? My posts average about 80-90 likes, and I just crossed 500 followers. Am I flying under the radar?

Of course, then I have to ask myself, why do I care? Do I WANT that negativity? Am I that desperate for validation?

Any thoughts?
