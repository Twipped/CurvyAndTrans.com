The mannequins that Target uses for Ava & Viv products are size 24. They provide a proper example of just what the clothes will look like for a woman of that size, and I absolutely cherish their presence. I'm often doubtful if an outfit will actually look good at my size, and I am thankful to Target for having them there. It's an impressive contrast to Torrid, whose mannequins are Torrid Size 00 (in other words, a US size 10).

Hearing some punkass 15 year old point and laugh at a representation of my own body didn't make me sad, it made me *_furious_*. How dare this little shit mock an example of [40% of American women](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17543266.2016.1214291?journalCode=tfdt20). I wanted to walk over there and curse at him for being such a fatphobic asshole.
