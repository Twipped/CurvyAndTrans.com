I’m calling this my belated New Years Eve outfit, but I love this dress so much I might wear it more often. It hugs me in all the right ways and makes my bust look awesome. My wife was downright flabbergasted when I walked out of the bedroom. I found this dress last month at Ross, manufactured by En Focus Studio, and it’s a perfect example of how the numbers don’t matter, because it’s a size smaller than I could usually fit into. I pulled it off the rack, thought to myself “I bet I can fit into that” and went and tried it on. So happy I did.

It’s been almost two weeks since I did a full face of makeup and not only do I feel out of practice, it honestly feels weird. I’m not gonna stop doing eye looks, but I might start using less skin coverage and contouring in my day to day face. Then again, this could just be because I’m approaching the end of my cycle and my skin chemistry is shifting... Oh, and these aren’t new glasses, I’ve had them for a while and felt they’d go better with this dress than my blue frames. I don’t usually wear them because they’re so short that I feel half blind.

Unfortunately I can't find this dress anywhere online to link to it.
