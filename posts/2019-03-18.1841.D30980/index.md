First day back into the office after Thursday’s garbage. I tried to bring the fierceness with my makeup but my morning music had me in too much of a dancing mood.

I didn’t want to come to the office today. I wanted to stay home. At work we had a morning waffle breakfast, and they specifically scheduled it today so that I could attend (Mondays are the only days I’m sure to be at the office), so I had to come in. Good thing too, nobody thought to bring in non-stick spray. I basically took over as waffle chef because nobody else knew how to do it. Three waffle makers if different sizes, cooking away in sequence. We added green cake dye to the mix for St. Patrick's day.

The air has been tense this morning. He’s been avoiding me and I’ve not been talking to him. Planning to go home at lunch.

I’ve had this ASOS dress since December, but this is the first time I’ve worn it. I figured a green dress was most appropriate.
