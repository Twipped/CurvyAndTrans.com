## Managed Dysphoria

Growing up in the closet, even when you don't know you're in the closet, becomes an existence of coping mechanisms intended to alleviate dysphoria. The following are ways in which a closeted trans person may find to alleviate the dysphoria they experience in their day to day lives.

- When a video game gives you the option of choosing your gender, you tend to choose differently than your assigned gender. This may be accompanied with excuses to defend that choice. "It defaulted to male and I didn't care." "I don't want to stare a guy's butt for hours."

- A preference for literature and film with characters of your true gender, or with characters who break gender norms (Mulan, Little Women)

- Pornographic outlets which satisfy strong desires or feel more relatable, such as a draw towards gay/lesbian porn, bridal kink, or transformation sequences.

- Crossdressing or performing drag

- Finding excuses to cut hair short, or to grow it out.

- Shaving of body hair, or a refusal to shave hair you're expected to.

- Wearing loose and baggy clothing that hides the shape of your body.

- Avoiding social gatherings whenever possible, seeking isolation.

- Becoming intimately educated about some gender associated topic, such as men's or women's clothing design

- Obsessively working out (AFABs)

- Helping cis partners to shop in order to live vicariously through their presentation.

Because so much abuse is handed down on to gender non-conforming children, many trans people grow up learning to hide their natural personalities out of sheer necessity. Many trans people speak about having a phase of life where they attempted to "buy-in" on their assigned gender, performing masculinity or femininity to extremes in order to try to "fix" themselves. This leads to repression tendencies which may even superficially appear toxic, but are simply the results of trying to hide every scrap of their true selves.

- Growing and meticulously grooming facial hair (the so called "denial beard")

- Taking up makeup artistry in order to perfect a high femme look.

- Presenting extremely masculine or hyper feminine.

- Avoiding any conversation about fashion for any gender. Dissociating whenever fashion conversations or activities occur.

- Obsessively working out (AMABs)

- Assuming a strongly stereotyped gender role in a relationship (eg, the dutifully modest housewife)

- Marrying and having kids in anticipation that it will "fix" what's wrong with you.

- Buying in to ultra-conservative attitudes towards gender and sexuality

- Homophobia and Transphobia expressed in self defense to ward off suspicion.

- Aggressively passive engagement in anything connected to ones true gender.


Finally, another very common coping mechanism is to find means of escapement or mental engagement in order to forget your own feelings.

- Intensely investing large amounts of time into hobbies

- Long hours spent at work

- Chain binging movies, tv shows or books.

- Spending all idle time in video games or on social media

- Obsessively cleaning ones living space

- Sleeping. Lots and lots of sleeping.




## Impostor Syndrome

^^^<!--[--><div class="card borderless right span3">{!{ {{> tweets ids=(array

> [Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

Society in general is very good about making trans people doubt themselves. We receive tons and tons of subliminal messages through out our lives saying that being trans isn't normal and that anyone who is has to be exceptionally special. Cis media's obsession with the "born in the wrong body" narrative has led to a lot of false information being internalized by trans youth. Many, *many* trans kids grow up thinking they aren't actually trans because they don't *know* that they are a different gender, they just wish they were.

On top of this, messages saying that trans people hate their bodies or hate their genitalia has polluted the awareness landscape, so that many people who either do not experience physical dysphoria (or simply think theirs isn't very strong) go around believing they aren't "trans enough".

***[YES, YOU ARE TRANS ENOUGH](https://www.amazon.com/Yes-You-Are-Trans-Enough/dp/1785923153/)***

On top of this, the constant messaging from transphobic media that trans people are not actually their true genders and are simply trying to trick people into believing otherwise gets internalized like a virus. This creates a lot of self doubt about the authenticity of one's gender, especially in the face of so many gender stereotypes. Seeing ones self fail to meet those stereotypes can make it very easy to convince yourself that you do not live up to your own gender (note, cis men and women get this too, far too often).

Furthermore, due to a history of transphobic abuse, many trans people suffer from damaged self-esteems, and often already have difficulty with self doubts. Gender Dysphoria also causes depression, which further contributes to and reinforces those doubts. This all leads into a massive cluster of self invalidation that can lead someone to struggle over and over again to accept their own gender identity.

But here's the thing... only trans people are worried about if they are actually transgender! A cisgender person does not have this obsession with their identity, they think about it, they process it, they move on. If you keep returning to these thoughts over and over again, this is your brain telling you that you took a wrong turn.

#### Autogynephilia

This pattern was strongly reinforced during the late 1980s when the Autogynephelia (AGP) theory of Ray Blanchard gained a lot of traction as trans awareness was just starting to escalate. AGP is a pseudo-scientific explanation intended to "explain" the source of trans women's identities using [paraphilias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia). Blanchard separated trans women according to if they were attracted to men or to women, while simultaneously invalidating their womanhood. His work completely ignored transgender men, and he dismisses non-binary identities outright.

AGP attests that straight trans women are actually just gay men who seek a feminine appearance to draw desire from straight men, and that trans lesbians are actually straight men who have become so obsessed with their desire for women that they wish to become a woman in order to gain sexual gratification from themselves.

Blanchard's theory largely hinged on the way that presenting feminine often resulted in sexual arousal within newly transitioning women. You see, most of his study subjects were patients who were trying to seek hormone therapy for the first time, and as such were still very new to presenting female.

Yes, it boggles the mind, but this was actually considered a valid theory of psychology for years, it appeared in college textbooks. Blanchard's research studies did not meet scientific rigor, and his data was found to be extremely flawed (he manipulated his patients, and simply just threw out any data that didn't fit his hypothesis). A lot of his theories are based in misogynistic views of womanhood, and the man never actually involved any cisgender women in his study to function as a control group. You can read more about how flawed the theory is in Julia Serano's excellent essay, [The Case Against Autogynephilia](https://www.juliaserano.com/av/Serano-CaseAgainstAutogynephilia.pdf).

AGP had been thoroughly dismissed by modern psychology by the late 2000s, but the damage has been done. In the public's eye, trans women were all perverted fetishists. Media portrayals of trans women mirrored this attitude, further spreading negative imagery into the public consciousness.

Trans women then internalize these messages, and come to the conclusion that they are not actually transgender, just fetishists. It happened to me, it's happened to nearly every millennial trans woman I know who figured themselves out as a teen.

You are not a fetishist, the feeling you get from thinking of yourself as a woman is gender euphoria.


#### Patriarchal Oppression

A common source for invalidation for AFABs is the conflation of gender with the systemic oppression of women, particularly among non-medically transitioning non-binary people. The message of "oh you just don't want to be a woman because of how women are treated" is far too often heard, and it can deeply infest your subconscious to the point of self doubt. Yes, being seen as a woman can really suck, but that has absolutely nothing to do with one's gender.

Radical Feminism's messaging of abandoning female gender roles can also conflate ones own feelings. "Am I actually non-binary, or am I just a feminist?" "Am I actually a man, or am I just a very butch lesbian?" These kinds of doubts sneak in and fester like weeds.

Then you have the problem of people believing that to be non-binary is to be androgynous, and to be androgynous is to be less feminine. Feminine enbies are valid! It is OK if you do not want to remove your breasts. It is OK if you enjoy your curves. It is OK if you do not mind being called "she" and "her". That does not make you any less transgender.

If you feel like you are not a binary woman, than you are not a binary woman. Cis women do not experience that detachment.

#### Toxic Masculinity

Male assigned kids grow up positively drenched in messaging of what it is to "be a man". There are so few examples of positive masculinity in popular media, and AMAB Masculine Enbies are also commonly erased in trans representation that being a gender queer male can feel very lonely. AMAB Enbies are often either grouped in with gay cis men or treated like trans women.

You can just be gender-queer! Your identity is valid!

#### Transmedicalism

This one hits *everybody*. Transmedicalism (aka Truetrans, aka Truscum) is a transgender idology derived from the Harry Benjamin scale (ranks 6 and 7). It seeks to reinforce the pre-WPATH rules, requiring intense physical dysphoria, demanding medical transition, and invalidating all non-binary identities. At its core, transmedicalism is supremacy and a push back against the expansion of the transgender identity. They wish for more gatekeeping than we have today, and would prefer to see fewer people receive treatment for their gender dysphoria.

To put it succinctly, transmedicalists hate that the newer generation "has it so easy," despite the fact that many of their ranks are part of that generation. This ideology started among disgruntled trans elders, but has since spread to other binary individuals, particularly among young trans men.

If a trans person's first exposure to transness is a transmedicalist, this can severely set back their own self-acceptance and push them even further into the closet. Transmed's are well known to actually tell people "No, you are not trans."

**Do not believe these lies.**
