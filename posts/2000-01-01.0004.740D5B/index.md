Transgender people have existed as long as the human race itself, and many ancient cultures recognized more than just two genders within the human existence, but it has only been in the last 100 years that a scientific and medical understanding of trans people has become well documented, and with that a proper philosophical and psychological understanding of the transgender experience. Even the word "transgender" only dates back to 1965 when John Oliven proposed it as a more accurate alternative to David Cauldwell's term, "transsexual".

To be transgender is to have a gender identity which does not match the gender you were presumed to have based upon your genitals. This can mean a person born with a penis is actually a girl, that a person born with a vulva is actually a boy, or that a person with either genital configuration may not fit either side of that spectrum and is non-binary.

This experience of discontinuity between the internal and external self is what we describe as Gender Dysphoria. Every trans person, regardless of their position within or outside of the gender binary, experiences some form of Gender Dysphoria. This is something of a political topic within trans communities, as different groups have their own ideas of what Gender Dysphoria is, how it manifests, and what qualifies a person as being trans. By and large, however, this debate is feckless and fruitless, as the definition above encompasses the beginning and the ending of how these terms intermingle, as I hope to demonstrate in this essay.

### A Brief History of Gender Dysphoria

In 1948 a German endocrinologist named Dr. Harry Benjamin was contacted by Alfred Kinsey (yes, [*that* Kinsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey)) in regards to a child he had become aware of. The teenager who had been born male was thoroughly convinced that they were actually a girl and wanted help to correct their body. The mother, wishing to help her daughter develop into the girl she knew herself to be, had reached out to Kinsey for help. Working with the family, Dr. Benjamin developed a protocol of estrogen treatment for the teen and helped them to find surgical help.

Benjamin then went on to refine his protocol and treated thousands of patients with similar feelings over the course of his career. He refused to take payment for his work, instead taking satisfaction from the relief he granted these patients, and using their treatment to further his understanding of the condition. He coined a term for this feeling of incongruence in 1973: Gender Dysphoria. Unfortunately, this term would not be used in the United States until 2013, the American Psychiatric Association opting for the term Gender Identity Disorder instead.

<a href="../scale.gif" class="card right span4"><img src="../scale.gif" alt="" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Harry Benjamin Diagnostic Scale</span></a>If you are a trans person reading this, you may have heard the name Harry Benjamin before, but probably not in a favorable context. In 1979 his name was used (with permission) in the forming of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA), which released a Standards of Care for transgender people. This SoC came to be known as the Harry Benjamin Rules, and were infamously limiting in regards to how Gender Dysphoria could be diagnosed. Patients were placed within a six tier scale based upon their level of misery and sexual dysfunction. If you did not land at Tier 5 or higher, classified as a "True Transexual", you were usually rejected for treatment.

The problem was, Tier 5 and 6 required that you had to be exclusively attracted to your own birth sex. Transition *had* to be making you straight, not gay, and bisexuals were not allowed. You also had to be experiencing severe distress with your body and genitals, and already be living as your true gender without treatment. Many trans people got around these limitations through community coaching and performative presentations, but for many people (myself included) it was believed that if you did not fit all the criteria, then you were not trans enough to transition.

In 2011 the HBIGDA reorganized itself to respond to mounting pressures in trans understanding and acceptance, taking on the new name World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). Under guidance by actual transgender people (a first for the organization), WPATH then proceeded to release an entirely new Standards of Care (version 7, the first in ten years) which abandoned the Benjamin Scale, focusing on specific individual symptoms and disconnecting gender from sexuality entirely. Two years later, in 2013, the American Psychiatric Association changed their diagnostic criteria to match the WPATH SoC in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) version 5, replacing Gender Identity Disorder with Gender Dysphoria. With this change, medical transition became available to all trans people in the United States.


### So What *Is* Gender Dysphoria?

> **Dys·pho·ri·a** - *Noun*   
> A state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life. The opposite of euphoria.

  <span class="card-body">What Dysphoria Feels Like</span>
</a>There is a common misconception among both cisgender and transgender people that Gender Dysphoria refers exclusively to a physical discomfort with ones own body. Consequently, proponents of SoC 7 and DSM-5 have taken to a habit of saying that you do not have to have dysphoria to be transgender. This statement is often repeated like a mantra, as it informs people who do not feel significant body discomfort that they may also be transgender.

However, this belief that body discomfort is central to Gender Dysphoria is in fact a misconception, and is not even a majority component of a Gender Dysphoria diagnoses. Gender Dysphoria crosses a large number of all aspects of life, including how you interact with others, how others interact with you, how you dress, how you behave, how you fit into society, how you perceive the world around you, and yes, how you relate to your own body.

In principle, Gender Dysphoria is a feeling of wrongness intrinsic to the self. There is no logical backing to this wrongness, there is nothing which explains it, you can not describe why you feel this way, it is just there. Things in your existence are incorrect, and even knowing which things *are* incorrect can be hard to properly identify.

Evey Winters described it extremely aptly [in her Dysphoria post](https://eveywinters.com/2019/10/14/on-dysphoria-before-enduring-and-after/).

> Have you ever been sitting somewhere in a public or a formal place and all of a sudden the bottom of your foot itches? It’s not like you can remove your shoes right there and scratch it, so you endure the feeling of dying inside while this itch grows and grows until you are ready to murder the next person that speaks to you.
>
> Or when I was younger I used to watch cable TV in the mornings before school. Because it was cable TV in rural WV in the early 90’s, every so often I’d turn on my favorite channel to watch my shows while I ate my maple oatmeal and I’d be seeing Power Rangers — but the audio would be from another station (usually the weather channel). The video was fine. The audio was fine. But the mismatch between them? That’s the kind of frustration that sits with you all day as a child.
>
> It’s the feeling you get when you ask for a crisp refreshing Diet Coke and the server says, “Is Pepsi ok?”
>
> It is knowing that something is wrong and not being able to do a damn thing about it.

The way I used to describe it is like wearing an adult's glove when you are a child. You can put your hand into the glove, and your fingers feed into the digits of the glove, but your dexterity with the glove is severely hindered. You might be able to pick something up, but you can not manipulate it like an adult could. Things just aren't quite right.

How does this manifest? I'm going to break this down into 8 categories:

1. Euphoria
2. Physical
3. Biochemical
4. Social
6. Societal
7. Presentational
8. Historical

However, first I must stress something very important. So important that I am putting it into big bold letters.

**EVERY SINGLE TRANS PERSON EXPERIENCES A DIFFERENT SET OF DYSPHORIA SOURCES AND INTENSITIES**

There is no one single trans experience, there is no standard set of feelings and discomforts, there *is no one true trans narrative*. Every trans person experiences dysphoria in their own way to their own degree, and what bothers one person may not bother another.

Ok, that disclaimer out of the way, lets get to the meat and potatoes.

### Euphoria

> **Eu·pho·ri·a** - *Noun*   
> A feeling or state of intense excitement and happiness. Elation, joy, glee.

Before I can talk about discomfort, I have to talk about relief. Gender Euphoria is itself a sign of Gender Dysphoria. You might be asking yourself, "how can happiness be sadness?" The answer to that is simple.

Imagine a person who was born in a cave, who spent their entire life living underground, their only source of illumination being candles and oil lamps. Imagine they've never been above ground, they don't even know the surface exists. Then one day a cavein happens in a side tunnel, and reveals an opening to the surface. Sunlight pours into the opening, and at first it is blinding and the person runs away in fear. Later they return to the opening, and as the person's eyes adjust they look out through the hole and see a bright and brilliant world full of colors they didn't even know existed.

That world is scary, it's huge and full of unknowns, so they crawl back into the cave for safety, but that hole is still there, and they see the light every time they pass it. Gradually they peek out more and more frequently, and further and further from the opening. They start to want that light, they find reasons to visit it more often.

Eventually they realize that they don't want to go back into the hole any more. They have to go back, because that is where their family and friends are, but this place is so much better, they want to stay here. Going back into the hole feels wrong, it starts to hurt to be in the dark so much.

This is what Gender Euphoria is like, it is brief flashes of a light that may be too bright to handle at first, too confusing to understand, but as time goes on you become more accustomed to them and you realize that this is where you belong, and the darkness becomes the dysphoria.

Many trans people have no idea how much pain they are in until they find small bits of relief. Cosplay, stage acting, drag, role playing games, video games; small little forays into an different gender than they have lived as. They find that it feels just a little bit more comfortable. They'll make up excuses for why ("If I'm gonna be looking at this character's ass, it might as well be a girl's ass."), they'll try to convince themselves it's all just for fun, or an artistic expression. They might tell themselves that the bits of joy they feel at hearing a different pronoun are just novelty. But soon they find themselves looking for reasons to get that more often. More and more frequently they're role playing characters of a different sex, building more costumes, buying more clothes, performing more often. You find yourself wanting to do that all the time, because it just feels better than your real life, and being "you" starts to hurt. Eventually, that becomes the costume.

This is the most fundamental reason why we as a community say "you do not need dysphoria to be trans", because black ink on a black canvas isn't visible without close examination and a lot of light.

Anything that can be a source of dysphoria has an equal and opposite euphoria.

Examples:

- Being gendered correctly
- Being addressed by your chosen name
- Wearing correctly gendered clothing
- Seeing and feeling changes in your body
- Seeing yourself in the mirror (removal of depersonalization)
- Socializing in a way that conforms with gendered expectations
- Getting a haircut in a masculine/feminine/androgynous manner
- Shaving your legs
- NOT shaving your legs
- Being included in something you wouldn't otherwise because of your assigned gender (eg, bridal party or bachelor shower)
- Feeling sexy / having sex in a way that aligns with your gender and sexuality.

Even just being out in the world as yourself and being seen as yourself can be massively euphoric.

**What euphoria is NOT** is a sexual high, turn on, or fetish. Sometimes euphoria can trigger a sexual response, and there are many factors at play that cause that (feeling good about your body is a turn on, for example), but it is not a source of sexual excitement. Trans people are not "getting off" on presenting or acting like their true selves.

That said, many people who have not yet realized they are trans may resort to fetishes and kinks to express their gender and/or relieve their dysphoria. They may maintain some of these kinks through transition. There is no shame in this, how they find sexual fulfillment is their own business. However, these things are *alongside* their gender. A trans person's sense of gender persists indefinitely, it does not go away when they go back to their daily lives.

### Physical Dysphoria

This is the one everybody has heard of, the "born in the wrong body" narrative. So what body features are we talking about here? Thankfully, medical science breaks these down neatly for us:

- **Primary Sexual Characteristics**
  In a word, genitals. In more words, all sexually dimorphic features which are established during pregnancy. This includes external genitalia (penis, scrotum, labia, clitorus, vagina), gonads (testicles, ovaries) and other reproductive organs (uterus, prostate/skene's gland).

  None of these are changable without surgical intervention (tho the prostate effectively becomes a skene's gland under hormone therapy, and vice-versa).

- **Secondary Sexual Characteristics**
  These are the features which develop during and after puberty. This includes (but is certainly not limited to) fat distribution (waist, hips, butt, thighs, arms, back, cheeks and jaw line), muscle mass and build, skeletal build (height, size of feet and hands, width of shoulders, bone thickness and density), skeletal structure (shape of hips and pelvis, shape of the brow and cheek bones), skin texture and tone, deepening of the voice, breast development, facial hair, body hair... basically everything that we use to observe the sex of an adult in day to day interactions.

  Many of these change with a switch in hormone profiles, some of them are one way trips (voice drop and breast development), some can only happen during first puberty while the body is producing elevated levels of growth hormone (bone differences). Some of them can be undone surgically (Voice Feminization, Facial Feminization/Masculinization), some can be surgically enhanced (Breast Augmentation, Brazillian Butt Lift), and some cannot be changed at all.

Physical dysphoria manifests in several different ways. Sometimes this is felt in a sort of phantom limb phenomenon, where the person can feel sensations from a penis or vagina that is not there, an ache in a uterus that does not exist, or a sense of absence on the chest from breasts that have not grown in.

It can be felt as a sort of *reverse* phantom effect, where the person is persistently aware of something that should *not* be there. The brain is receiving sensory input that it does not expect, such as the weight of breasts, or the presence of testicles or a uterus, and this input takes priority because it isn't expected.

It may be felt as horror or revulsion when looking at or touching the external genitals, triggering emotional outbursts or a strong desire to remove the offending organ. AFAB (assigned female at birth) trans people may experience feelings of wrongness during menstruation, or a sense of alien disconnect from their hormone cycle.

It can manifest as a compulsion to be rid of certain body traits, such as obsessively shaving body or facial hair. This can also manifest in the opposite compulsion, leading to meticulous grooming of those traits in order to try to control them, like maintaining a perfect beard, persistently keeping ones nails manicured and polished, or spending hours in the gym attempting to hone ones shape.

Sometimes it may just simply be a feeling of being incorrect, which you may not even attribute to gender or sex. For most of my life I believed that the reason I hate my body was because I was fat. It wasn't until I started transition that I realized I don't hate my fat at all, I hated having *male* fat. The feminine curves that HRT gave me make me feel so much more in tune with my body.

<div class="card right span3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Me pre-hrt: I don’t hate my penis at all.<br>Me 2.5 years on hrt: GET THIS THING OFF ME.</p>&mdash; 𝓙𝓸𝓬𝓮𝓵𝔂𝓷 (@TwippingVanilla) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwippingVanilla/status/1184837108919230464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
The dysphoria one feels about their body can and will change over time, for better and worse. Many trans women today enter into transition feeling no disconnect with their genitals, for example, but later find that changes as the other more in your face sources melt away, stimulation differs, and their genitalia itself changes shape and function. Some may assume that they will absolutely need facial feminisation surgery, but then 2 years in realize they're actually ok with how they look. I used to be terribly sensitive about my widows peak, but now that my hair has grown in I find I'm completely ok with my hair line.

It's ok for you to realize you need more or less than when you started.

It's ok if you don't hate anything about your body, and just wish you looked more feminine or masculine.

It's ok if you don't need medical transition *at all*. Body feelings are not the be-all-end-all of transition.

### Biochemical Dysphoria

The primary sexual features of the body begin development during the 8th week of human gestation. Typically by week 11 it is possible to determine the genitals of a uterus via ultrasound. The brain, however, forms itself in [between weeks 14 and 24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989000/#Sec5title). Current prevaling understanding of neurological development suggests that it is during these 10 weeks when the brain will either masculinize or feminize based upon the presense of testosterone in the infant's bloodstream (initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, or introduced from other sources). This process locks the brain into a pattern of either desiring estrogens or androgens.

If your brain is wired for one gonadal hormones (such as testosterone) and your body produces the other hormone (such as estradiol), this can result in a biochemical malfunction within your brain chemistry. This produces a sort of brain fog, a reduction in mental capacity, and a general state of anxiety and unease. This is the source of the first two symptoms that often alleviate with medical hormonal therapy, depersonalization and derealization (DPDR).

**Depersonalization** is a disconnect from your own body, an inability to believe that the person you see in the mirror is actually yourself. You feel like you are watching someone else in your body. You may find yourself not caring about what happens to your body, lack of concern with weight changes or improving your fitness because you have no ownership of this fleshy vehicle that transports you around your life.

Zinnia Jones [gives these descriptions for Depersonalization](https://web.archive.org/web/20190406141617/https://genderanalysis.net/2017/06/depersonalization-in-gender-dysphoria-widespread-and-widely-unrecognized/):

- A sense of detachment or estrangement from your own thoughts, feelings, or body: “I know I have feelings but I don’t feel them”
- Feeling split into two parts, with one going through the motions of participating in the world and one observing quietly: “There is this body that walks around and somebody else just watches”
- Feeling as if you have an “unreal” or absent self: “I have no self”
- Experiencing the world as distant, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, colorless, artificial, like a picture with no depth, or less than real
- Being absorbed in yourself and experiencing a compulsive self-scrutiny or extreme rumination
- Having an ongoing and coherent dialog with yourself
- Feeling like a veil or glass wall separates you from the world
- Emotional or physical numbness, such as a feeling of having a head filled with cotton
- Lacking a sense of agency – feeling flat, robotic, dead, or like a “zombie”
- Inability to imagine things
- Being able to think clearly, but feeling as if some essential quality is lacking from your thoughts or experience of the world
- A sense of disconnectedness from life, impeding you from creative and open involvement with the world

You may put little care into your physical appearance, reaching for only the basic utilitarian needs in clothing and personal hygiene. Alternatively, you may hyperfocus on your appearance, attempting to try to spark some kind of joy, any kind of feeling of pride in your own body, only to be met with more hollowness.

You may be unconcerned with the state of your body, perhaps not even fearing death, because you have so little attachment to your life.

**Derealization** is a detachment from the world around you, a mental sense that everything you perceive is false.

- Your surroundings seem alien or unfamiliar, even if you've always been there, like someone has swapped out your house for a stage replica.
- Moving through the world feels like you're walking on a treadmill, with the buildings moving around you instead of you through them.
- Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about, as if you were separated by a glass wall, or like they are just actors pretending to be the people they claim to be.
- Surroundings that appear distorted, blurry, colorless, two-dimensional or artificial, or a heightened awareness and clarity of your surroundings. Leaves on trees feel like they have extra sharp edges, for example.
- Distortions in perception of time, such as recent events feeling like distant past.
- Distortions of distance and the size and shape of objects
- Feeling like a passive observer in the events of your life

If you found yourself strongly relating to The Matrix or The Truman Show, you might be experiencing derealization. This can also manifest as a feeling of otherworldliness, like you don't belong in this society. You're just walking around waiting for your super powers to appear, or for an owl to fly up with your letter to Hogwarts. As a teen I was obsessed with an episode of The Outer Limits where a boy discovers a spaceship under his house and learns that he and his parents aren't actually human.

Then vs Now.</span></a>DPDR sometimes comes with an emotional stunting. You are able to laugh and find humor, but rarely ever genuine joy. Moments of sadness or grief cause you to just go numb, dissociated by the event that caused it. This can also go in the opposite direction, where the person is under so much anxiety that their emotional response is extremely disproportionate to the catalyst, resulting in severe crying or violent outbursts from seemingly small events.

It's important to note that DPDR is not exclusive to Gender Dysphoria. This condition is co-morbid with several other mental health issues, including chronic depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder. DPDR should not be taken as a sign of Gender Dysphoria purely on its own, it's just a big alarm signal that something is very wrong. It's also usually pretty easy to spot externally, once you know how to watch for it. People with DPDR tend to have a mile long stare as they move about in the world; eyes so gloomy and dead that they look like a shell. One of the most common comments on transition timelines is how the eyes gain so much spark.

### Social Dysphoria

Social Dysphoria is centered in the way the outside world perceives you and how others address you. All social gender dysphoria orbit around one central concept: Am I Seen As My Gender? Is this stranger seeing me as a man or a woman?

This is where pronouns come in to play; being addressed with a gendered pronoun such as she, he, him, or her, which is not the pronoun that aligns with our gender, is extremely discomforting. This is true for *all* people, including cisgender people, but where a cis person will be insulted, a trans person will feel hurt. Hearing the wrong pronoun is a reminder that the person you are talking to does not recognize you for the gender that you are.

The same also applies to names. Being called by one's given name (deadname) instead of their chosen name can feel invalidating when done ignorantly, and downright dismissive when done intentionally.

Social Dysphoria may manifest pre-transition in feelings of isolation or misplacement when interacting with others. For example, an AMAB (Assigned Male At Birth) trans person may find themselves very uncomfortable when socializing with a group of men, like they just don't fit in. They may find themselves deeply hurt when women shy away from them in public, and get frustrated that they aren't able to form platonic relationships with women due to heterosexual expectations.

It may also manifest as joy or embarrassment at being labeled as your true gender while still living as your assigned gender. Examples:

- An AMAB person being labeled a girl, intending insult, but it causing them to blush rather than get angry.
- An AFAB person being called Sir, and feeling better for it.

The discomfort caused by social dysphoria can pressure a trans person to act and present in an exaggerated manner in order to try to convince the rest of the world that they really are who they say they are. Trans feminine people may concentrate on makeup and feminine clothes, and become quieter in order to seem more demure, speaking in a higher voice. Trans masculine people will lean on masculine clothing styles, stand taller, suppress displays of emotion, start speaking louder, and make their voices intentionally deeper.

#### Physical vs Social Dysphoria

Some physical traits which may cause discomfort all the time for some trans people may only manifest as a social dysphoria for others. For example, some people may only be self conscious about their physical appearance when it causes them to be misgendered or clocked (read as being trans), and feel completely comfortable when interacting in environments where they are always seen and treated as their true gender.

I, myself, have no direct physical dysphoria around my voice, I actually really enjoy singing in my natal baritone, and when I am home with just my family I let me voice relax. When out in public, however, being able to speak in a feminine voice plays a critical role in my being seen as a woman by strangers, so I put a lot of effort into training it into a feminine sound. My feminine voice turns on the instant I answer the phone or leave the house, it isn't even a conscious thing.
