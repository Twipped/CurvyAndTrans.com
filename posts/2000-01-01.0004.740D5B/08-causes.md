For a more in-depth coverage of this I suggest [reading my article on the subject](/p/A37736/i-am-biologically-female/).

The short of it is, the brain starts out female and is masculinized via the same processes as the gonads and genitals, but it happens at a different time, and is subject to more complex influences. Sex is a spectrum, gender is a spectrum, and there is a lot of room for the two to not align. We don't yet fully know exactly why trans people end up with gender identities that don't match their genitals or their DNA, but they do.

Sadly, western society has actively prevented a deeper understanding of gender. Ancient civilizations understood it well, but colonialism wiped them off the map. 100 years ago, [scientists in Germany were actively studying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_f%C3%BCr_Sexualwissenschaft) transgender medicine and made extraordinary advancements, until the nazis burned it all in 1933. Conservative and fascist pressures in the modern day have hindered advancements in transgender healthcare whenever possible.

Yet, progress continues, and every few years we learn a little bit more.

What we know for certain is that it is not a psychological condition, it is not something caused by trauma or by any external influence, nothing can make a person transgender. It happens in the womb, and is not something that a person can choose to be, any more than they could choose their race or their eye color. It has nothing to do with sexual orientation, it has nothing to do with kinks or fetishes, it has nothing to do with social influences from their parents or from their peers. [Transgender children are as firm in their identities as cisgender children are.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2020/12/29/study-transgender-children-recognize-their-authentic-gender-at-early-age-just-like-other-kids/#20bbb14526bf).
