Hastily put together look this morning so I could get out the door to have my blood sucked for labs.
It was just supposed to be a thyroid and lipid test but my doc decided to toss a hormone check on there too which means I have to get labs done on the day of my E injection. That means today, a holiday, or Saturday, which is worse. LabCorp is busy as hell right now, I’m gonna be here all morning. We Bought A Zoo is playing in the lobby. It was playing when I was here three months ago, and two months before that. You’d think they could change the DVD every so often.

I bought four tops yesterday while at Torrid, this being one of them. Unfortunately, all of them came off the clearance rack and I can't find them on the website. I also bought two bras but then got home and realized the cup was WAY too small. I missed the way it wasn’t scooping the side tissue when I was trying them on. I was running out of time while I was there, and didn’t check the fit properly. Ah well, that just means I have another reason to go to Torrid.
