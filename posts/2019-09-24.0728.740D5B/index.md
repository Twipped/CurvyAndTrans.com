### A Brief History

In 1948 a German endocrinologist named Harry Benjamin was contacted by Alfred Kinsey (yes, [*that* Kinsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey)) in regards to a child he had become aware of. The teen, who had been born male, was thoroughly convinced that they were actually a girl and wanted help to correct their body. The mother, who wished to help her daughter develop into the girl she knew herself to be, had reached out to Kinsey for help, and Kinsey then turned to Dr Benjamin. Benjamin developed a protocol of estrogen treatment for the teen and helped them find surgical help.

Benjamin went on to refine his protocol and his understanding of the condition, treating hundreds of patients with similar feelings, completely for free. He helped thousands of transgender people become themselves. In 1973 Dr Benjamin coined a term for this condition: Gender Dysphoria. Unfortunately, in the United States it would not be used to describe the feeling of incongruence that trans people experience until 2013. Instead, the American Psychiatric Association created the term Gender Identity Disorder.

<a href="../scale.gif" class="card right span3"><img src="../scale.gif" alt="" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Harry Benjamin Diagnostic Scale</span></a>If you are a trans person reading this, you may have heard the name Harry Benjamin before, but not likely in a favorable context. In 1979 his name was used (with permission) in the forming of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA), which released a Standards of Care for transgender people. This SoC came to be known as the Harry Benjamin rules, and were infamously limiting in regards to how Gender Dysphoria could be diagnosed, placing patients onto a six tier scale. If you did not land at Tier 5 or higher, classified as a "True Transexual", you were usually rejected for treatment.

The problem was, Tier 5 and 6 required that you had to be exclusively attracted to your own birth sex. Transition *had* to be making you straight, not gay, and bisexuals were not allowed. You also had to be experiencing severe distress with your body and genitals, and already be living as your true gender without treatment. Many trans people got around these limitations through community coaching and performative presentations, but for many people (myself included) it was believed that if you did not fit all the criteria, then you were not trans enough to transition.

In 2011 the HBIGDA reorganized itself to respond to mounting pressures in trans understanding and acceptance, taking on the new name World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). Under guidance by actual transgender people (a first for the organization), WPATH then proceeded to release an entirely new Standards of Care (version 7, the first in ten years) which abandoned the Benjamin Scale, focusing on specific individual symptoms and disconnecting gender from sexuality entirely. Two years later, in 2013, the American Psychiatric Association changed their diagnostic criteria to match the WPATH SoC in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) version 5, replacing Gender Identity Disorder with Gender Dysphoria. With this change, medical transition became available to all trans people in the United States.

Other nations across the world have adopted their own protocols based on WPATH, some with less zeal than others, but the the rest of this article I will be focusing on the DSM-V classification of Gender Dysphoria, as it is what I understand the best.

### So What *Is* Gender Dysphoria?

> **Dysphoria** - *Noun*
> A state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life. The opposite of euphoria.

There is a common misconception among both cisgender and transgender people that Gender Dysphoria refers exclusively to a physical discomfort with ones own body. Consequently, proponents of SoC 7 and DSM-5 have taken to a habit of saying that you do not have to have dysphoria to be transgender. This statement is often repeated like a mantra, as it informs people who do not feel significant body discomfort that they may also be transgender.

However, this belief that body discomfort is central to Gender Dysphoria is in fact a misconception, and is not even a majority component of a Gender Dysphoria diagnoses. Gender Dysphoria crosses a large number of all aspects of life, including how you interact with others, how others interact with you, how you dress, how you behave, how you fit into society, how you perceive the world around you, and yes, how you relate to your own body.

In principle, Gender Dysphoria is a feeling of wrongness intrinsic to the self. There is no logical backing to this wrongness, there is nothing which explains it, you can not describe why you feel this way, it is just there. Things in your existence are incorrect, and even knowing which things *are* incorrect can be hard to properly identify.

Author Evey Winters described it extremely aptly [in her Dysphoria post](https://eveywinters.com/2019/10/14/on-dysphoria-before-enduring-and-after/). <a href="../dysphoria1.gif" class="card right span3"><img src="../scale.gif" alt="" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">What Dysphoria Feels Like</span></a>

> Have you ever been sitting somewhere in a public or a formal place and all of a sudden the bottom of your foot itches? It’s not like you can remove your shoes right there and scratch it, so you endure the feeling of dying inside while this itch grows and grows until you are ready to murder the next person that speaks to you.

> Or when I was younger I used to watch cable TV in the mornings before school. Because it was cable TV in rural WV in the early 90’s, every so often I’d turn on my favorite channel to watch my shows while I ate my maple oatmeal and I’d be seeing Power Rangers — but the audio would be from another station (usually the weather channel). The video was fine. The audio was fine. But the mismatch between them? That’s the kind of frustration that sits with you all day as a child.

> It’s the feeling you get when you ask for a crisp refreshing Diet Coke and the server says, “Is Pepsi ok?”

> It is knowing that something is wrong and not being able to do a damn thing about it.

The way I used to describe it is like wearing an adult's glove when you are a child. You can put your hand into the glove, and your fingers feed into the digits of the glove, but your dexterity with the glove is severely hindered. You might be able to pick something up, but you can not manipulate it like an adult could. Things just aren't quite right.

How does this manifest? I'm going to break this down into 8 categories:

1. Euphorical
2. Physical
3. Biochemical
4. Social
6. Societal
7. Presentational
8. Historical

However, first I must stress something very important. So important that I am putting it into big bold letters.

**EVERY SINGLE TRANS PERSON EXPERIENCES A DIFFERENT SET OF DYSPHORIA SOURCES AND INTENSITIES**

There is no one single trans experience, there is no standard set of feelings and discomforts, there *is no one true trans narrative*. Every trans person experiences dysphoria in their own way to their own degree, and what bothers one person may not bother another.

Ok, that disclaimer out of the way, lets get to the meat and potatoes.

### Euphoria

> **Euphoria** - *Noun*   
> A feeling or state of intense excitement and happiness. Elation, joy, glee.

Before I can talk about discomfort, I have to talk about relief. Gender Euphoria is itself a sign of dysphoria. You might be asking yourself, "how can happiness be sadness?" The answer to that is simple.

Imagine a person who was born in a cave, who spent their entire life living underground, their only source of illumination being candles and oil lamps. Imagine they've never been above ground, they don't even know the surface exists. Then one day a cavein happens in a side tunnel, and reveals an opening to the surface. Sunlight pours into the opening, and at first it is blinding and the person runs away in fear. Later they return to the opening, and as the person's eyes adjust they look out through the hole and see a bright and brilliant world full of colors they didn't even know existed.

That world is scary, it's huge and full of unknowns, so they crawl back into the cave for safety, but that hole is still there, and they see the light every time they pass it. Gradually they peek out more and more frequently, and further and further from the opening. They start to want that light, they find reasons to visit it more often.

Eventually they realize that they don't want to go back into the hole any more. They have to go back, because that is where their family and friends are, but this place is so much better, they want to stay here. Going back into the hole feels wrong, it starts to hurt to be in the dark so much.

This is what Gender Euphoria is like, it is brief flashes of a light that may be too bright to handle at first, too confusing to understand, but as time goes on you become more accustomed to them and you realize that this is where you belong, and the darkness becomes the dysphoria.

Many trans people have no idea how much pain they are in until they find small bits of relief. Cosplay, stage acting, drag, role playing games, video games; small little forays into an different gender than they have lived as. They find that it feels just a little bit more comfortable. They'll make up excuses for why ("If I'm gonna be looking at this character's ass, it might as well be a girl's ass."), they'll try to convince themselves it's all just for fun, or an artistic expression. They might tell themselves that the bits of joy they feel at hearing a different pronoun are just novelty. But soon they find themselves looking for reasons to get that more often. More and more frequently they're role playing characters of a different sex, building more costumes, buying more clothes, performing more often. You find yourself wanting to do that all the time, because it just feels better than your real life, and being "you" starts to hurt. Eventually, that becomes the costume.

This is the most fundamental reason why we as a community say "you do not need dysphoria to be trans", because black ink on a black canvas isn't visible without close examination and a lot of light.

### Physical Dysphoria

This is the one everybody has heard of, the "born in the wrong body" narrative. So what body features are we talking about here? Thankfully, medical science breaks these down neatly for us:

- **Primary Sexual Characteristics**
  In a word, genitals. In more words, all sexually dimorphic features which are established during pregnancy. This includes external genitalia (penis, scrotum, labia, clitorus, vagina), gonads (testicles, ovaries) and other reproductive organs (uterus, prostate/skene's gland).

  None of these are changable without surgical intervention (tho the prostate effectively becomes a skene's gland under hormone therapy, and vice-versa).

- **Secondary Sexual Characteristics**
  These are the features which develop during and after puberty. This includes (but is certainly not limited to) fat distribution (waist, hips, butt, thighs, arms, back, cheeks and jaw line), muscle mass and build, skeletal build (height, size of feet and hands, width of shoulders, bone thickness and density), skeletal structure (shape of hips and pelvis, shape of the brow and cheek bones), skin texture and tone, deepening of the voice, breast development, facial hair, body hair... basically everything that we use to observe the sex of an adult in day to day interactions.

  Many of these change with a switch in hormone profiles, some of them are one way trips (voice drop and breast development), some can only happen during first puberty while the body is producing elevated levels of growth hormone (bone differences). Some of them can be undone surgically (Voice Feminization, Facial Feminization/Masculinization), some can be surgically enhanced (Breast Augmentation, Brazillian Butt Lift), and some cannot be changed at all.

Physical dysphoria manifests in several different ways. Sometimes this is felt in a sort of phantom limb phenominon, where the person can feel sensations from a penis or vagina that is not there, an ache in a uterus that does not exist, or a sense of absence on the chest from breasts that have not grown in.

It can be felt as a sort of *reverse* phantom effect, where the person is persistently aware of an organ that should not be there, as the brain is receiving sensory input that it does not expect. The weight of breasts, the presense of testicles or a uterus.

It may be felt as horror or revulsion when looking at or touching the external genitals, triggering emotional outbursts or a strong desire to remove the offending organ. AFAB (assigned female at birth) trans people may experience feelings of wrongness during menstruation, or a sense of alien disconnect from their hormone cycle.

Sometimes it may just simply be a feeling of wrongness, which you may not even attribute to gender or sex. For most of my life I believed that the reason I hate my body was because I was fat. It wasn't until I started transition that I realized I don't hate my fat at all, I hated having *male* fat. The feminine curves that HRT gave me make me feel so much more in tune with my body.

<div class="card right span3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Me pre-hrt: I don’t hate my penis at all.<br>Me 2.5 years on hrt: GET THIS THING OFF ME.</p>&mdash; 𝓙𝓸𝓬𝓮𝓵𝔂𝓷 (@TwippingVanilla) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwippingVanilla/status/1184837108919230464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
The dysphoria one feels about their body can and will change over time, for better and worse. Many trans women today enter into transition feeling no disconnect with their genitals, for example, but later find that changes as the other more in your face sources melt away, stimulation differs, and their genitalia itself changes shape and function. Some may assume that they will absolutely need facial feminization surgery, but then 2 years in realize they're actually ok with how they look. I used to be terribly sensitive about my widows peak, but now that my hair has grown in I find I'm completely ok with my hair line.

It's ok for you to realize you need more or less than when you started.

It's ok even if you don't hate anything about your body, and just wish you looked more feminine or masculine.

It's ok if you don't need medical transition *at all*. Body feelings are not the be-all-end-all of transition.

### Biochemical Dysphoria

The primary sexual features of the body begin development during the 8th week of human gestation. Typically by week 11 it is possible to determine the genitals of a uterus via ultrasound. The brain, however, forms itself in [between weeks 14 and 24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989000/#Sec5title). Current prevaling understanding of neurological development suggests that it is during these 10 weeks when the brain will either masculinize or feminize based upon the presense of testosterone in the infant's bloodstream (initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, or introduced from other sources). This process locks the brain into a pattern of either desiring estrogens or androgens.

If your brain is wired for one gonadal hormones (such as testosterone) and your body produces the other hormone (such as estradiol), this can result in a biochemical malfunction within your brain chemistry. This produces a sort of brain fog, a reduction in mental capacity, and a general state of anxiety and unease. This is the source of the first two symptoms that often alleviate with medical hormonal therapy, depersonalization and derealization (DPDR).

- **Depersonalization** is a disconnect from your own body, an inability to believe that the person you see in the mirror is actually yourself. You feel like you are watching someone else in your body. You may find yourself not caring about what happens to your body, disconcerned with weight changes or improving your fitness because you have no ownership of this fleshy vehicle that transports you around your life.

  You may put little care into your physical appearance, reaching for only the basic utilitarian needs in clothing and personal hygine. Alternatively, you may hyperfocus on your appearance, attempting to try to spark some kind of joy, any kind of feeling of pride in your own body, only to be met with more hollowness.

- **Derealization** is a detachment from the world around you, a mental sense that everything you perceive is false, and the people in your life are merely actors in a very complicated play. Moving about your day to day life feels like you're walking on a treadmill, and the world is moving around you, instead of you moving through it, or like you're an alien observer watching but not participating.

  If you found yourself strongly relating to The Matrix or The Truman Show, you might be experiencing derealization.

DPDR sometimes comes with an emotional stunting. You are able to laugh and find humor, but rarely ever genuine joy. Moments of sadness or grief cause you to just go numb, dissociated ny the event that caused it. This can also go in the opposite direction, where the person is under so much anxiety that their emotional response is extremely disproportionate to the catalyst, resulting in severe crying or violent outbursts from seemingly small events.

### Social Dysphoria

Social Dysphoria is centered in the way the outside world perceives you and how others address you. 

This is where pronouns come in to play; being addressed with a gendered pronoun such as she, he, him, or her, which is not the pronoun that aligns with our gender, is extremely discomforting. This is true for *all* people, including cisgender people, but where a cis person will be insulted, a trans person will feel hurt. Hearing the wrong pronoun is a reminder that the person you are talking to does not recognize you for the gender that you are.

The same also applies to names. Being called by one's given name (deadname) instead of their chosen name can feel

The discomfort caused by social dysphoria can push a trans person to act and present in an exagerated manner in order to try to convince the rest of the world that they really are who they say they are. Trans feminine people may concentrate on makeup and feminine clothes, and become quieter in order to seem more demure, speaking in a higher voice. Trans masculine people will lean on masculine clothing styles, stand taller, suppress displays of emotion, embrace toxic masculinity, start speaking louder, and make their voices intentionally deeper.
