I love wearing this dress, it shows off every curve so well and just feels good to wear. Unfortunately I had to ditch the thigh-highs in favor of leggings before I left the house because they kept slipping down my legs. I couldn’t decide if I liked the cardigan better tied or down. Tied up it obscures the neckline, which is a pretty core feature of this dress.

I tried something new with my eyeshadow and I don’t think I liked it. I was trying to create a sharp contrast between lid and brow, but because of the shape of my brow it just looked weird when I closed my eyes. Ah well.
