How’s this for a Transformation Tuesday glow up? The left photo is from January 2005. I was a very angry 24 years old, deeply depressed, and frequently having dysphoric anxiety attacks (tho I didn’t know thats what they were), but believed most of it was because I was so lonely. My evangelical religious upbringing kept me from ever dating anyone, and I was convinced that there was a woman shaped hole in my life (I was right, just not the way I thought). I remember feeling very wronged by the world back then, and refused to accept responsibility for anything bad that happened to me. In some ways I could see my then-self demonstrating some incel-like attitudes, which really disturbs me. I don't think I ever would have slid that far, but just having peripheral connections to that ideology makes me feel revolted by myself.

I _loved_ this shirt, so much that when the first one deteriorated and fell apart, I bought it again. Sadly, this particular power symbol shirt is no longer available. It was made as fan merch for the [AppleGeeks](http://www.applegeeks.com/) webcomic. I used to wear it all the time until I got too fat to feel comfortable in it. It's been sitting in a drawer for four years. I'll probably start wearing it again, now.

Fun fact, people used to run up to me at tech and geek events and slap the power button. I doubt anyone would dare do that to me now (and if they do dare, they're gonna get slapped!).
