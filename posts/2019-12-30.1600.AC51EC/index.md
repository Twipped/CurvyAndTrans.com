I entered this decade a boy, but I exit it a woman.

At the start of 2010 I was barely married 3 months. We were living in a mobile home my mother had paid for, I was working for a company that did not appreciate my worth, and parenthood was barely a glimmer in our eyes. I was hopelessly addicted to World of Warcraft (WotLK has just come out), and just starting to feel the onset of the dysphoria that my relationship with Kat had forestalled.

Today I am 3 months past my tenth wedding anniversary without an end in sight. We own our second house, I make more than twice what I did then, working for a company that values me immensely. I barely even play video games these days at all, because I am far too busy being co-mom to my two darling children, and my dysphoria (tho not fully quenched) is well reduced. This isn’t even my final form!

Ten years is a long time. It’s nearly a quarter of my life. What a wild and crazy decade it’s been.

Happy New Year, Everyone. May your 2020s be fruitful and merry.
