Yes it's a maternity dress, I don't care, I love it and I got it on clearance for $20. This is seriously one of my favorite casual dresses right now because it's so soft and I can wear it without a bra.

Maternity dresses work very well for late transitioning women, the cuts are always accommodating for extra girth in the abdomen and we tend to have large bellies.

This was also one of the first dresses I bought that was only a XXL but still fit me really well. I found it by sheer luck on the clearance rack at a Target I only go to once in a blue moon. As soon as I tried it on, I knew I had to buy it.
