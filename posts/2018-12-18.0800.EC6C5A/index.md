I don’t do basic very often, but it’s not outside my wheelhouse.

Very minimal makeup for today because my skin is still healing from last night’s laser session, not that you can tell. I did a snail mucus and bee venom mask before bed, and then slept with my Dr Jarts Tiger Grass night cream. It did wonders, usually my face is a disaster for days after an LHR session.
