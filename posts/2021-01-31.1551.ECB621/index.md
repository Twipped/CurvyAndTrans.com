This is partly why the WHO is reclassifying gender incongruence as a disorder of sexual development. Being trans is not a mental disorder, but a significant portion of trans people do experience an endocrine disorder in the alignment of their gonadal hormones.

*This* is what medical intervention treats. It is no different than addressing PCOS, or prostate cancer, or hypothyroidism, and it needs to be treated the same way by our medical system. If a cis man has testicular cancer, removing them doesn’t even require pre-auth, but I had to get three letters proving I’m sane and then wait four months to get mine removed, when one of them was a fucking tumor!
