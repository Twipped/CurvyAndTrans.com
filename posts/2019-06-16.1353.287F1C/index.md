Selfies can be amazingly empowering and create so much euphoria, but they tend to produce a slightly distorted viewpoint, because we instinctively search for the best angles and the best lighting. It’s not that selfies are a lie, they’re just biased.

Gender Euphoria obtained from a candid photo, however... that’s pure. A candid photo can destroy you, or it can make you feel amazing. My wife took these two photos of me today while we were at Poway Lake, and they really made me happy when I saw them.

There’s nothing here that I hate. No features jumping out at me, nothing overtly masculine, just a mom out for a walk with her kids.

I’m in a happy place right now.

Bonus Pic: A rare case where I opened my forward facing camera and didn’t completely hate my face, double chin and all.
