Last week [@the.sarah.wolf](https://www.instagram.com/the.sarah.wolf/) did a #postyourstudio, and I wanted to join in, but I kept forgetting to take the photos.

This is my home office, itâ€™s where I work from home three days a week and get my gaming fix. The shelves on the wall, as well as the desk itself, are Ikea furniture that I assembled hung myself.. The monitors are also wall mounted on movable arms.

I have a tradition that every time we go to Disneyland, I have to buy a Stitch, so I have a burgeoning collection of Stitch plushies and figurines. Kat and I also collect Funco pop and other small bits of fandom.
