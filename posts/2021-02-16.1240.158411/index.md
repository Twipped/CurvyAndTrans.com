The UK media is in a fit this week as transphobe after transphobe releases "opinion" pieces about trans people trying to erase women by forcing them to stop calling their chests breasts. This derives from a blatant misinterpretation of a new guideline issued by the NHS directing hospital staff to be prepared to use gender inclusive language for patients assigned female at birth who do not identify as women (eg, trans men and non-binary transmascs) and are uncomfortable with terminology that centers womanhood, such as breastfeeding.

Here is the "offending" document:

{!{
  {{import '~/img' images['1'] className="card span2 center"}}
}!}

Note the second paragraph, which explicitly states that gender neutral language should not be used *exclusively* because it erases people who *do* identify as women.

Basically they've constructed a completely false narrative and are now shoving it down the public's throats in hopes of inspiring further hatred towards trans people. Don't believe the hate.
