Far too much energy in trans rights discourse is spent trying to justify why we exist to people who aren't going to understand the reasons anyway. What is more important is educating that we *do* exist, have *always* existed, and we aren't going to go away. You can't extinguish trans people any more than you can left-handedness, or autism (despite numerous people's best attempts to do so). This is the same shift that happened in pursuit of gay rights; for decades there was intense focus on *why* homosexuality existed, to no answers. We still don't know what part of human development controls what morphology a person is drawn towards, but it doesn't matter, because the discourse changed.

Once science stopped trying to prove why homosexuality exists and people just accepted that some people are gay, thats when the tide shifted (at least, in North America and parts of Europe). While there are still many people who wish to suppress gay people, society as a whole accepted that doing so is harmful, and sexual orientation became a protected category of human existence. The same needs to happen for trans people before widespread acceptance can gain a foothold.

Furthermore, so much anti-trans discourse revolves around "biological sex" that discussing gender in terms of how it isn't related to sex does nothing to counter the claims being made. The house is on fire, and we're trying to put it out by digging a well. We need to teach people that sex is more than whats between someones legs, we need to fix the damage done by a hundred years of bad biology education.
