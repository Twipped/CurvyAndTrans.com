My thought process this morning:
- Not in a maxi mood.
- Too cold for a summer dress, need sleeves
- These colored midi dresses could work but they’re boring alone, maybe with a skirt.
- Hmm, brown, I have a brown skirt. This could work.
- I have beige leggings too...
- WIN!

Called my laser place today to see when they could fit me in, since it’s been ten weeks now and my mustache shadow is getting pretty bad. Soonest they could fit me in is four weeks away. I guess business is good! No wonder considering how cheap her rates are.
