Just got in my first [Shein.com](http://www.shein.com) haul, and I loved everything in it. I was really worried about sizing, because the size charts are erratic, but it all fit! The red kimono I’m wearing is from that haul. Dress is by Stretch is Comfort, and it has pockets! I haven’t worn it in probably six months because as my body changed shape it stopped feeling comfortable, but it feels great today!! The leggings are a Terra & Sky Christmas Reindeer Fairisle leggings from Walmart, which sadly are no longer available after Christmas.
