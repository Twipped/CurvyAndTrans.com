Another 2009 to 2019 timeline. I think 2009 may be the year with the most photos of me pre-transition, largely because of our wedding. I was riding a relationship high and didnâ€™t feel as intensely depressed all the time.

I took the pic on the left as a set of photos to use as profile pictures. Itâ€™s funny to me how in my 20s I always tried to put forward this tough guy aesthetic in photos. Look at me, Iâ€™m mister serious, donâ€™t mess with me, Iâ€™ll bite your nose off. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ™„ I donâ€™t know where it came from, because it wasnâ€™t me at all. Kat will attest to how much of a teddy bear Iâ€™ve always been, and when I say teddy bear I mean like that bear from the old Snuggles Fabric Softener commercials.
