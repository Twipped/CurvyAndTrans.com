### Enter the Internet

My first exposure to the Internet was in seventh grade. The lab that my mom worked in on the college campus had a computer on the campus network, which had the only broadband connection in town. From time to time I'd be allowed on that computer and would surf around on the Gopher ecosystem, reading the various silly articles that propagated within college networks. I remember finding a file full of jokes about Bill Clinton and laughing hysterically, tho I didn't get some of the jokes.

The World Wide Web was a toddler at this point, but was on the cusp of turning into a big deal. The university added NCSE Mosaic to their IT infrastructure and I discovered this wonderful thing called HyperText Markup Language. You could structure pages with all sorts of styling without needing any expensive software, you just typed up special tags in a text editor. I found a book at the local library about HTML and started learning the basics. The book was horrible by todays standards, as this was years before World Wide Web Consortium would come to exist, and HTML at the time was a wild west of functionality. But, it was enough to teach me how to make my first page. I typed up a page on my grandma's computer, loaded the file on to a floppy, rode my bike to the university campus to find a computer with Mosaic on it, and saw the page I had written.

Within the year the web started to explode. Netscape Navigator came out, introducing the concept of color and more layout options, and suddenly web design was a thing. The very first website that I saw with a colored background was Fox's promotional site for the Who Shot Mr. Burns Simpsons cliffhanger, it was colored Simpsons Yellow. I happened upon the website for Sierra Online, the PC games manufacturer, and discovered their webchat. It was remarkably advanced for the time, delivering conversations in realtime via a stream of responses instead of reloading the page every so often. It was on that webchat that my online personae was born.

Sierra required registering for a nickname with a password. I entered the name Chip, after the protagonist of Disney's Almost Human movies. The name was taken, so I tacked an "er" on to the end, and Chiper was born. I continued to use that name for the next 22 years.  It was through the Sierra Webchat that I learned of community server maintained by the government of a local township. Anyone who lived in mid-michigan could sign up for an email account and website host, completely for free. I started learning more and more about building websites, experimenting to find the limits of what I could accomplish in the browsers of the time. Netscape Navigator 2.0 came out and introduced JavaScript, and I was hooked. A programming language that anyone could write, without any special software or training? This was the best!

In the fall of 1995 my mom bought us our first modern computer, an Apple Power Mac 6200 (technically a Performa 6214), which came with an inkjet printer and a 56k modem. Because my mother was a student and employee of the university, we had free access to their dial-up service. Sometimes it was hard to get an open line, and there would be a lot of time spent dialing and re-dialing to just get busy signals, but once I was on I had the entire web at my fingertips... largely unsupervised.

I learned four programming languages on that Mac, tinkered with 3D rendering, and made online friendships that later became real life friendships which that still persist to this day. That Mac was a gateway to a world of discovery, and I was allowed enjoy it, encouraged to pursue it, without any prejudices or judgments. It was expected for boys to be into computers, especially antisocial loaners who had trouble relating to other people. On the Internet I was normal, or at least as normal as everyone else.

### A Secret Joy

Living in that house in-town brought the opportunity for something else. By this point my mother was both working fulltime and was a fulltime student at the university, so many days I never saw her between breakfast and dinner. That gave me a lot of opportunities to explore a feminine presentation. The house we were in had two bedrooms, but my mother's room had no closets, so instead she kept her dresses and blouses in my closet. Additionally, there were a lot of clothes in my mother's dresser that she could no longer fit into after regaining some of the weight she lost after my parents separated. One of those was a red underwire bra made of stretch charmeuse. I have no idea what size it was, but it fit me quite well. I didn't completely fill the cups, more than you'd probably expect (thanks, gynecomastia!), and a little sock padding took care of the rest. I was 14 years old.

Wearing that bra made me feel so much more whole. I would look down and see breasts that part of me knew should be there. I'd put on one of my t-shirts and stand in front of the bathroom mirror, turning side to side, filled with a sense of warmth that I did not have the words to explain. On days when I knew my mom would be gone for a long time, I would wear that bra for hours as I just did stuff around the house. I would try on my mom's dresses, some of which fit, some of which didn't.

One day I had just gotten into one of her fancier dresses when I heard the front door of our house open. I sprinted across the hallway into the bathroom and closed & locked the door. When she called out my name, I acted like I had just gotten out of the shower as I struggled my way back out of the dress and rolled it up into a towel. I waited until I knew she wasn't in line of site and then ran back into my bedroom in my underwear, stashing the dress behind my bed until I had a chance to put it away.

From the same drawer of clothing too small for her to wear I purloined several other garments. My first pair of leggings in shiny neon blue spandex, a pair of hot pink bike shorts (it was the 90s, neon colors were in), and a one piece swimsuit. I often took to wearing these under my clothes when I would go to school. One day I failed to take the bike shorts off properly while changing in the locker room at school, and one of my bullies spotted them.

> "Do you have pink underwear?"   
> "What? No!"   
> "I saw pink underwear!"   
> "I don't have pink underwear! Why are you looking at my underwear?"

After that I stopped changing in the locker room for PE and took to changing in the bathroom before class. I never felt comfortable changing my clothes around boys, and I was far less likely to be harassed that way.

The piece of clothing that I loved the most, however, was an old nightgown of my mother's. It was a pink satin tank gown, fairly basic, but extremely soft and comfortable. On the rare occasions when she would be out of town, I would wear it to bed. In the winter I could stand over the large heating vent in our livingroom and let it billow out from the air. It made me feel glamorous and powerful. I loved that nightgown, and kept it even after I had gotten rid of all my other clothes. When I was 20 years old my mother happened to find it in my room and threw it away, telling me it wasn't appropriate for me to have it.

<a href="../05.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../05.jpeg" alt="Me riding on my mountain bike in front of our house." class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Summer, 1997, outside our house in the middle of town.</span></a>I kept all these clothes in a bag that I kept hidden in the ceiling in my room. At the time I had a bunk bed, not because I had anyone to sleep on the other bunk, but just because I liked the enclosed space that it gave me. I put curtains across the sides and had mounted things to the sides of the bed. It was like my little fortress of solitude.

Having the upper bunk afforded me the opportunity to reach the dropdown ceiling in my bedroom (why the bedroom had a drop ceiling, I do not know). I could lift up one of the tiles and store things in the space above my bed. This was where I kept a plastic bag full of clothes, and a shoebox with various items that I knew I would get in trouble for owning, such as a couple R rated VHS tapes and a Zip disk full of all my digital porn.

I also experimented with makeup a few times. My mother didn't have much makeup, just some powder foundation and lipstick, but I would play with it and see how it felt. I could tell it was something I wanted to know more about, but it just wasn't available to me. Two times my mother caught me, tho she only remembers the first, when she found me with lipstick all over my face. The second time, she could tell I had been into her makeup because it was messy and out of order. She grilled me on why I was getting into it, but I couldn't answer the question. I didn't have an answer to the question. How could I explain that I wanted to wear makeup, when I knew I wasn't allowed to? I told her I had just been curious and was experimenting. She told me not to do it any more, and I stopped.

### Forbidden Wishes

One day in 1995, sitting in my bed wearing my bra, with a yellow lined notepad in my lap, I began to write a letter to my mother. I cannot remember the exact words of the letter, but I remember the content. I told her that I hated being a boy, that I wanted to live as a girl. I told her that I wanted to wear girl's clothes, grow out my hair, be seen as a young woman. I told her that I wanted to have a sex change.

These were the words I knew. This was the language that appeared on tabloids and in daytime talk shows and movies like Ace Ventura (which was the most awful kind of transphobic representation, but it was what I had). I didn't know hormone therapy existed, I didn't know what transition entailed, I didn't even know the _word_ "transition"; all I knew was that medical science could turn me into a girl, and I wanted it. I wanted it with every fiber of my existence. I wanted to be pretty, I wanted to wear dresses, I wanted to have breasts and a butt, hips and a waist. I wanted to enjoy fashion, have sleep overs with girl friends, go shopping and dance. I didn't want to date guys, I had no attraction to boys, but I wanted to be romanced and courted, receive flowers and be pampered. I wanted people to praise me for being beautiful, not for being handsome.

All these things I felt in my heart, but had no language to express them, so instead I left the letter at that. I folded the letter into thirds and sealed it into an envelope, on which I wrote "To Mom". I walked out to the kitchen and placed the envelope on the table for her to find when she came home. Half an hour later I walked back out and took the envelope back into my bedroom. I put the envelope into the shoe box in the ceiling, and never opened it again.

### Lost Hope

Trying to learn anything about transness in the mid 90s was extremely difficult. There was limited information available at my public library, and searching the Internet was like wandering through a room blind. The first major search engines on the scene were WebCrawler, Lycos and AltaVista, but they all worked based on frequency of words on the page, not any kind of page ranking, so the results were extremely easy to pollute and finding actual information was next to impossible through all the porn. What I did find... wasn't very comforting.

The majority of early trans Internet spaces [were difficult to find](https://gizmodo.com/an-oral-history-of-the-early-trans-internet-1835702003). They existed in niche corners of the net, in usenet groups, gated web chats, AOL spaces, and secluded IRC channels. If you didn't know how to find them, your odds of stumbling across them were slim. The first trans site that approached any kind of mainstream presence was Susan's Place, which launched in 1996. Unfortunately, Susan's Place did (and still does) largely cater to a specific audience: older white trans women living in the closet, many of whom expressed their gender through cross-dressing and sissy fetishization. Discussions about transition largely centered around the gatekeeping that was present in the medical field, and how you had to be a specific kind of woman to get help. The things that I found through that board did not give me hope for a future as a girl.

It was also at this time that I, unfortunately, learned about the term Autogynephelia (henceforth abbreviated AGP). If you don't know this term, well good, because it's awful. AGP was coined in the 70s by a psychologist named Ray Blanchard. Blanchard created a theory about trans women (and just trans women, he didn't care at all about trans men) that reduced our gender feelings down to an extreme demonstration of sexual orientation. He believes that trans women who are attracted to men were "homosexual men" who felt such a strong attraction to men that they felt the need to look like women in order to attract straight men. Trans women who were attracted to women, however, were "straight men" that fetishized femininity so strongly that they wished to become women themselves. Blanchard's model did not acknowledge the existence of bisexuality. Under Blanchard's dichotomy, any trans woman who is a lesbian is just a fetishist.

Blanchard's system was recognized as a valid explanation for several decades, and it massively affected the available treatment options for trans people. You could not medically transition if doing so meant you would "become" gay. The gay and bisexual men and women who did successfully transition did so by lying to doctors about their feelings abd who they were dating, and by never getting married (not that they could once the state recognized them as legally their gender).

I learned this term from somewhere, I'm not exactly sure, I suspect it may have been my mother's psychology 101 textbook, but it may have also been on the Internet. Either way, I internalized this. I believed that my feelings of wishing to be a woman were purely fetishistic, and as such were not something I should pursue openly. Growing up in the Witness faith had indoctrinated me that fetishes were sinful and disgusting, something I had to suppress... and suppress I did.

At the age of 16, when my mother and I moved away from Mt. Pleasant to Midland, Michigan, entering into 11th grade. I took this as an opportunity to reinvent myself, to cut ties from the feminine boy everyone knew, and embrace my own manhood. I threw away the bra, the clothes, everything I had attached to my womanhood, save for that nightgown that I cherished so much. I took the letter that I had written to my mother, which had sat in that box for over a year, and I burned it. In the new town I took on a new personae, I became the young man that was expected of me.

The desires never went away, however, they continued to pester at me, and I had to find an outlet.

### More Than Meets The Eye

The little town that my dad lives in has a tiny library no bigger than a two bedroom house. When we still lived there, my mom would take me there occasionally to check out kids books. There was one book that I became obsessed with, it was called [Balloonia](https://www.amazon.com/Balloonia-Childs-Play-Library-Audrey/dp/1904550495). The story is about a little girl named Jessica whose brother tells her about a magical land where all balloons go when they're let go. The girl demands to be taken there, and her balloon obliges her, turning Jessica herself into a balloon. The book is a classic be-careful-what-you-wish-for type story designed to teach children not to be bratty or else they'll get what they deserve. The book had a much more significant affect on me, however. It triggered a feeling in me that I couldn't understand or explain. I wanted to be that little girl; I wanted to transform.

That feeling came to me again one night when I was at my grandmother's house. For most of my teen years she lived in an attached townhouse with a second floor and a full basement. She kept her television and her computer in the basement, so I spent many hours down there. One night I'm watching the Tales from the Darkside film (god do I ever miss the old SciFi Channel), alone and completely unbeknown to my grandmother.  The fourth segment of the film is titled Lover's Vow, and is about a man who is mugged in an alleyway and gets saved by this grotesque creature. The creature makes him promise a vow that he would never tell anyone about what he saw that night, and in return he would be brought good fortune. He promises, and as he is returning home from the scene he runs into a young woman on the street. The two of them fall in love, and from then on his life keeps getting better and better as he builds a career as an artist. They get married, have kids, everything is going great for him, but he can't stop thinking about this creature that he saw. He starts sketching it, compulsively, filling his drawing room with images of it. His wife gets worried, as this is clearly turning into an obsession. He breaks down and tells her the story. She starts crying, and then turns around and shouts "YOU PROMISSED YOU'D NEVER TELL!!".

What followed is one of the most gruesome transformation sequences I've ever seen, in fact I suspect it was probably edited when I saw it because the original sequence is far too gross for even cable television. I don't recommend going looking for it, you'll probably come away thinking I'm highly disturbed for what you see. The wife and their kids all turn into gargoyles, she takes the children, flies away to a rooftop, and they all turn to stone.

In the midst of the transformation, I orgasmed. I cannot explain it, and part of me is very disturbed with myself for it, but it happened all the same. Sitting there in the dark on my grandmothers floor, that sequence tapped deep down into a part of me that really, *really* wanted to metamorphosis, and it triggered an explosion of euphoria.  I didn't even touch myself, I just suddenly had very wet underwear. I got up and went over to her laundry space and used some paper towels to clean myself up as best as I could, and felt *extremely* embarrassed.

Thus began my divisive relationship with transformation pornography.

Initially there wasn't much fodder for this. This was before we had internet at home, so my only opportunities to explore this were through mainstream films. American Werewolf in London, the Species series, the pig scene in Willow, the transformations in The Witches...  However, once we had internet in our own house, I discovered the wonderful world of usenet porn, and `alt.binaries.multimedia.transformation`. Here was a treasure trove of images depicting transformation sequences of all sorts, as well as video clips from various films. Clearly, I was not the only person on the internet with this obsession.

Back then the vast majority of this content came from hentai, but that which wasn't came from furry fandom, a subculture I never became invested in myself, but was very familiar with. DeviantArt launched in 2000, and furry culture exploded online. With that came a massive surge in fetish/kink material. Suddenly there was a central place for the creators of this content to distribute it, where fans could not only find it and share, but could *pay* for it via commissions and physical prints. In 2004, DeviantArt instituted a new adult content policy which explicitly banned pornographic imagery, pushing a lot of those people over to sites that were less strict. Most of the furry community moved to FurAffinity and Tumblr, and many artists launched their own websites. The best way to discover new content, however, was through image boards like 4chan and F-chan.

I wanted to contribute back to this community that had enabled my outlet, so in 2010 I launched the r/transformation subreddit. At first it was just me crossposting content that I found on Tumblr and image boards. I did my best to link back to the original authors, and to tag the content according to what kind of transformation it featured. Whenever TF content showed up in other subreddits I frequented, I would leave a tag to the subreddit. The user base slowly grew over the first two years, and then suddenly blossomed. As I write this in 2019, the subreddit has over thirty one thousand subscribers and has awoken so many trans people that we had to put a section in the sidebar just to help guide people towards self discovery.

In 2018 [I stepped down as the senior moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/transformation/comments/8z5fnw/current_state_of_rtransformation_survey/e2gq2g4/) of the subreddit, as I had found that after transitioning I no longer was participating in that community any more. My fascination in the genre had completely dissipated after going through my own very real transformation.
