Kat and I got out for a nice dinner date and a walk along the beach at sunset. It was beautiful, and the water was incredibly warm, but I forgot to bring a towel and we both got soaked through our shorts. Great time all the same.

I do love living in San Diego, we so rarely take advantage of it but it is truly delightful to just drive 20 minutes and go for a walk on the sand.
