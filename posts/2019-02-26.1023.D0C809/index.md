It was the summer of 1999, and I stood outside the box office at the Pacific Theatre's Carmel Mountain 12 cinema shortly after noon, having just gotten off work for the day from my job at Borders Books & Music across the street. The film I was going to see was making enormous waves online, people were raving about this incredible action blockbuster, The Matrix, a title which at the time seemed cliche to anyone who had grown up on the Internet like I had.

The film was revolutionary at the time, both for its stunning special effects and intensely choreographed fight sequences, and for the idea that it posited... that the world was not real, but rather just a simulation running on a computer somewhere. This idea captivated so many people that [an entire philosophy](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Matrix_and_Philosophy.html?id=GSE5qlwGzCAC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false) sprung up around the movie.

For me, however, the film tickled something inside me, something I would not understand for another 17 years. The movie delt with concepts and feelings that I empathized with significantly, even tho I could not name them. It felt like the people who had written this story understood me and knew what it felt like to be me, as if they were living with the same existential troubles that I felt. Nine years later Lana Wachowski came out as transgender for the 2009 release of Speed Racer, the first film credited with her chosen name. Then in 2016 the news broke that Lilly Wachowski had also transitioned.

The Matrix is a trans allegory, depicting numerous metaphors for the experience of going through a gender transition. Now, you might be saying to me "Jocelyn, that sure seems like a stretch." After all, they made the film almost a decade before transitioning, how could that be true? Well, as they say, you cannot be told what The Matrix is, you can only be shown.

Credit where due, a lot of this post is inspired by [this fantastic twitter thread](https://twitter.com/glitchliz/status/966061698837876736) by Liz Bell.

The police and agents in the film represent the gatekeepers and parents of trans people.

Gatekeepers do everything they can to stand in the way of gender transitions, throwing up barriers and hoops to be jumped through at every turn.

Neo is a programmer who has problems with authority figures. Now, in the 90s this wasn't as common, so I can't call this an intentional link, but today the number one trade for trans women is software engineering or other computer related careers. It's astounding just how over represented trans women are in technology, and when you think about it, it makes sense. The tech industry is full of social outcasts, people who didn't fit into molds. The freaks and geeks, as it were, were strongly drawn to computer jobs because they had low requirements for socializing, and interpersonal problems were practically the norm.

Personally, computing gave me the opportunity to escape, to zone out and stop thinking about my life. I could delve into a problem and become absorbed by it, leaving my physical body behind. It was freeing.

Neo is up against a wall. He hates this existence, he hates the world he is in, but he feels like he doesn't have a real choice about how to continue. His only option is to follow the requirements set for him.

Breaking away from the cisgender heternormative lives that we grow up with is extremely hard, even painful. These principles are taught to us from the moment we can speak and we're surrounded with people who never question their position in these spaces. Even just realizing that one is gay is hard enough, but defying your assigned gender... it feels like insanity. Yet, the feelings persist, and we keep returning to it over and over again. We're left wondering why we are so strange, why we have been cursed with this affliction. Why can't we just be "normal"? We can't control if we're transgender, it just happens.

Many trans people give up, we try as hard as possible to forget, to ignore our feelings and to just live a normal life in the frameworks laid before us. We hide our heads in the sand and pray it will go away if we just do what we're told to do. We look across the chasm, we see an escape, but we are too afraid, the path is too dangerous, so we turn back.

I just wanted to point this out from this scene:

> Anderson excelled in the sciences, mathematics and computer courses. He also displayed apex aptitude for English and History. After some trouble with discipline at the age of 13-15, Anderson settled down to being a fairly well-regarded member of the school.

Aside from the mathematics part, this describes me to a T.

The bug represents internalized transphobia, preventing us from accepting who we are or accepting other trans people as just like us.
