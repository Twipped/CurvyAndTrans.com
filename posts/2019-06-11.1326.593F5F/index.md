This makeup was supposed to be really basic. I was sooo tired when I stood at my vanity to do it, and all I wanted was a little red shadow to compliment the dress I had picked for the day, but it snowballed. One red shade led to another red shade led to an orange shade led to a gold accent shade, led to liner and mascara, and by that point it was too bold to wear without foundation. Foundation led to contour, and you cannot contour without highlight, and a good highlight calls for a strong lipstick, and before too long I had a full face of makeup.

Dress is Targetâ€™s Ava & Viv from last Christmas season. Target is being very cruel to me lately, all their dresses were marked down to $20 in store, and the racks were positively packed full of great designs that I wanted... all just slightly too small for me to wear.
