Kat bought me this dress for my birthday last October, and then I never got around to wearing it because I was too afraid of the white. As far as I can tell, this is my first time ever wearing it... and wouldn’t you know it, it’s now too big on me.

Kat dropped in while I was taking my photos this morning, and she loved the picture so much that she said “post that everywhere!” So I am!

Bonus work selfie at the end of the carousel.
