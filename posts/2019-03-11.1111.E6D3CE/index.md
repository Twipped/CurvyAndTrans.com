The time change has firmly cemented that my problem has been too much light in my bedroom. Now that it’s still dark out while I’m getting dressed my photos are WAY better. I need to buy some shades.

Today marks the third day in a row that I’ve skipped foundation while doing my makeup. I picked up a couple new skin treatments from Sephora over last week and the difference is startling. First was Belif Aqua Bomb, which is a startlingly good moisturizer that leaves my skin remarkably plump and soft. The second is Too Faced Hangover Face Primer that seems to be doing amazing things for my pores and discoloration. Together, along with a few other primers, I was so happy with my skin that I didn’t feel like I needed anything else.

Dress is from Lane Bryant, but I have no idea what it's called.
