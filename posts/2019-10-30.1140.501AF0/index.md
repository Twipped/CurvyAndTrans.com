Hello, my gender goblins, crooked queers and plus size pirates. October is at an end, and I see it off with the boldest of my Witchy Wednesday looks.

On Friday I dismantle my Halloween lights and start working on Christmas decor. Katharine wants to put up her tree this weekend, and I’ve already mounted two strings of Christmas lights on the front of the house which are just waiting to be plugged in. This year I should have enough lights to *properly* create my rainbow oasis in the front yard, and even have net lights to drape out on the lawn. It’s gonna take some time to put together, and I probably need to get more extension cords.

Kudos to my cat Leonardo for presenting himself as the perfect familiar.
