I think it’s about time to give this one a whirl again. This is by far my favorite dress in my closet, but it is a tad bit ostentatious for working in a Southern California software development office, so it only comes out when I’m in a full on “fuckit I wear what I want” attitude. When it does come out, I put on the full Hollywood Glam show, because this dress deserves it.

I am exceptionally pleased with my makeup look today, and I owe it all to [@canditopia](https://www.instagram.com/canditopia/). Her blending tutorials have informed me so much on how to get the colors I want.
