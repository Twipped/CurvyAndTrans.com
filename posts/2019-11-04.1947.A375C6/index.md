Doing my Transition Tuesday post a day early, because today marks 30 months since I took my first estrogen pill. Two and a half years. Fitting that today would also be a shot day, which replaced my pills four months later.

I’m really proud of the woman I am today. It’s taken a lot of work to get here, a lot of emotional labor on my part and from my amazing wife who I am thankful for every single day.

I can’t say the journey has been fun… oh sure, there’s been a lot of fun moments, but honestly there’s been a lot of really shitty moments too that I happily would have skipped over. Still tho, I’m thrilled to have been able to walk that path.

I’m a girl! The dream I wanted more than anything for my entire life has come to fruition. It makes every day more glorious than the last.
