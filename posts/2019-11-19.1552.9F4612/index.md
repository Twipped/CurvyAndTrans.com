I *don’t* feel like I speak girl with an accent.. My mannerisms, my speech patterns, the way I walk, everything just came back. I did have to learn some things that I didn’t get to learn young, but that was easy enough.

However, sometimes I feel like I have a girl-speech impediment due to what male puberty did to my body, and really that can be just as bad as an accent. This isn’t even a metaphor, there are days where my literal voice reveals my history.

The rest of this, however, rings very true. I learned to hide, so that I could live today.
