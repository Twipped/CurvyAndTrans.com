My relationship with my daughter is ten times stronger than it was in the before times. We used to have so many conflicts, so much hostility and impatience. She was legit scared of me, and with good reason. I was a powder keg with a lit fuse, read to explode at any moment. I had no tolerance for her four year old antics, and no room for providing comfort.

I’m immensely patient with her now, where previously I would explode at the smallest slight. I’m more engaged, more available, more empathetic. When she’s upset, we talk it through, we work out her feelings. When I’m upset she tries to cheer me up.

Last night I got home well after her bed time, and when I walked in through the front door she came sprinting out of her room to hug me good night before going right back to bed. Kat told me that Sam had been waiting for me because she didn’t want to go to sleep without hugging me first.

This is such a precious gift, and I would not have had it otherwise. The idea that my transition has harmed my children would be laughable if it weren’t so insulting.
