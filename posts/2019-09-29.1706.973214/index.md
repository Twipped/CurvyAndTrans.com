I saw an article on Facebook that was a list of [things that sociable introverts want you to know](https://www.charlotteagenda.com/169386/7-things-that-extroverted-introverts-like-myself-wish-you-understood/) about their struggles. That’s not me, I’m the opposite, extremely extroverted (I am recharged by socializing, not drained) but loaded with crushing social anxiety. I felt inspired to write my own list, because people often think I’m introverted when I’m actually just anxious.

1. If I show up and the only people I know are engaged in conversations I can't get into, I'll probably just sit in the corner on my phone until I go home depressed. Please, engage with me! I'll talk your ear off once the ice is broken.

2. If I'm quiet at first it isn't because I don't want to talk, its that I don't know what to say, so I'm listening intently for points of engagement. Ask me questions.

3. I am starved for socialization, so I can't stop, won't stop. Tell me when you're ready to end the night.

4. Once I get to know people, I open up like a book. If we're hanging out with friends of yours that I don't know, please take the time to encourage some shared experiences. I know it's a lot of emotional labor, but it helps me so much, and I can carry the conversation once I'm integrated.

5. I can write amazing speeches, but standing up in front of a bunch of strangers to deliver it scares the shit out of me.

6. Please don't get offended if I can't remember your name. It's not that I don't care, it's that I was too freaked out when you told me it to be able to remember.

7. Sometimes I get so excited by good conversation that I let too much guard down and might accidentally hurt someone's feelings. I will probably then run away and cry. I'm sorry!

8. Please invite me to things, I'm too scared to ask!

9. ADHD Bonus Round:
  If your venue/setting is loud, I will be too overstimulated from sensory overload to be able to talk to anyone, and then probably won’t have a good time. Please take me to quiet places.
