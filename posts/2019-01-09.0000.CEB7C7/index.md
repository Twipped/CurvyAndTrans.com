Found this dress on the Target clearance rack last month and when I got home my wife swiftly declared it to be hers. She wore it to a wedding at the end of December and, must say, looked even more radiant in it than I do. Between that and the holiday break, today was the first chance I’ve had to wear it.

I keep finding myself loving Target's Isabel Maternity line; the clothes are all _extremely_ soft and ridiculously comfortable. They're spacious, but not baggy, and always delightfully stretchy. Part of me feels a bit of guilt for buying a maternity dress when I am not and can never be pregnant, but on reflection I have concluded that this is a result of misogynistic stigmas. Our culture idolizes maternity, places it on this pedestal, and separates it from the rest of womanhood. There is this air of "now you are a real woman" and anyone who hasn't carried a child is but a girl and undeserving of maternal blessings. This isn't fair to mothers and it really isn't fair to women who are infertile.

This dress is surprisingly heavy, the first time I picked it up off the rack I thought there had to be another garment on the same hanger, because it had so much heft to it. There's a lot of thick fabric here, and it makes wearing the dress kind of like wearing a hug. I don't think I have any other dress that is this comfortable to wear, short of perhaps my other Isabel Maternity dress.

Bonus photos today of some of the craftiness I get up to in order to secure that perfect shot. I looked great in the mirror but my photos kept coming out wrong because I couldn’t get my phone camera at eye level. GIVE IT THE CLAMPS!
