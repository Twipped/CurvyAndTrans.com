Today is National Coming Out Day, a day to celebrate the diversity of queerness, increase visibility, and let people know they are not alone.

I am many things. You may ask me questions about any of them.

- *Queer*, as in I am my own person and I will not be constrained by cisgender heteronormativity.

- *Gynephilic*, as in my sexual attraction is primarily to physical characteristics that result from estrogen (as opposed to androphilic, which is attraction to testosterone driven characteristics)

- a *Lesbian*, as in Valar Dohaeris.

- *Bisexual*, as in gender is a spectrum and my sexuality includes everyone but men.

- *Demiromantic*, as in, ok, maybe some men, but only after significant bonding.

- *Monogamous*, as in I am singularly devoted to one person by choice, not by nature.

- *Polyamorous*, as in my default state does not preclude romantic relationships with multiple people.

- *Transgender*, as in chromosomes are really more of a suggestion than a rule.

- a *Woman*, as in an Adult Human Female (that’s right, trans people use dictionary definitions too!)

- *Femme*, as in I don’t wear pants (leggings as pants doesn’t count).

- *Body Positive*, as in rolls, fat, cellulite and stretch marks have zero bearing on anyone’s worth or health, and all bodies are beautiful.

- *Fat Positive*, as in yes, I am fat. Fat is not a bad word, fat is not a feeling, fat is not a value judgement. Fat people do not get fat by choice, fat people do not stay fat by choice. Fatphobia kills!

- *Sex Positive*, as in sexuality is a colorful and diverse fractal of the human experience and we should never stigmatize or suppress that facet of our expression. Now pass me the Hitachi wand and lets talk about our kinks.

- *Neuro-Divergent*, as in I have ADHD (diagnosed) and am probably on the autism spectrum (unevaluated). I also have an anxiety disorder and C-PTSD.

- *Socialist*, as in no human being should ever be homeless, starving or without health care, regardless of their income or social status, and it is the government’s responsibility to ensure this.

- *Feminist*, as in equity for every person, regardless of gender, race, sexuality, disability or any other qualification. Lift people up, don’t hold them down.

- *Human*
