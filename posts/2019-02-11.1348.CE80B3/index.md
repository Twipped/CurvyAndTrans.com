This started out as yesterday‚Äôs outfit, and then I was like ‚ÄúI really like this look, I‚Äôm gonna go change and save this for work tomorrow.‚Äù So here we are.

This is the first time I‚Äôve changed my earrings in over eight months (last time I took the studs out was for my surgery in June). I‚Äôve been scared to try because last time they healed over after just 10 hours and we had to break through the skin. üò¨ It went smoothly, though, no pain and the rods went through easy. Hopefully that means I can start wearing earrings more.

Been cycled off my progesterone over the weekend for the duration of my period and, uhg, it‚Äôs like my face put on ten years. I go back on tonight and am really looking forward to it. I just do not feel like myself without it.
