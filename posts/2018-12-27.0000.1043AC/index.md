When you put on weight over the holidays but ain’t even mad because it went to _all_ the right places.

I try not to talk about weight stuff too much because it can be very triggering for people in the body positive community. Talk about diets or weight changes is often at ends with body positivity. I’ve been having 5-10 pound high/low swings for the last two months due to an increase in my progesterone dosage, and it’s doing so much for my figure. The fat burns off from all over but goes back on in my butt, hips and boobs. Sure it’s frustrating that it isn’t a steady downslope, but I cannot complain about what it’s doing for my curves.

I'm convinced this dress is cursed. This was the third time I had tried to wear it, and every time I managed to get a stain on it in the first 20 minutes.
