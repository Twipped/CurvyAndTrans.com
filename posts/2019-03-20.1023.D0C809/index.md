It was the summer of 1999, and I stood outside the box office at the Pacific Theatre's Carmel Mountain 12 cinema shortly after noon, having just gotten off work for the day from my job at Borders Books & Music across the street. The film I was going to see was making enormous waves online, people were raving about this incredible action blockbuster, The Matrix, a title which at the time seemed cliche to anyone who had grown up on the Internet like I had.

The film was revolutionary at the time, both for its stunning special effects and intensely choreographed fight sequences, and for the idea that it posited... that the world was not real, but rather just a simulation running on a computer somewhere. This idea captivated so many people that [an entire philosophy](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Matrix_and_Philosophy.html?id=GSE5qlwGzCAC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false) sprung up around the movie.

For me, however, the film tickled something inside me, something I would not understand for another 17 years. The movie delt with concepts and feelings that I empathized with significantly, even tho I could not name them. It felt like the people who had written this story understood me and knew what it felt like to be me, as if they were living with the same existential troubles that I felt. Nine years later Lana Wachowski came out as transgender for the 2009 release of Speed Racer, the first film credited with her chosen name. Then in 2016 the news broke that Lilly Wachowski had also transitioned.

The Matrix is a trans allegory, depicting numerous metaphors for the experience of going through a gender transition. Now, you might be saying to me "Jocelyn, that sure seems like a stretch." After all, they made the film almost a decade before transitioning, how could that be true? Well, as they say, you cannot be told what The Matrix is, you can only be shown.

Credit where due, a lot of this post is inspired by [this fantastic twitter thread](https://twitter.com/glitchliz/status/966061698837876736) by Liz Bell.

</div>

The police and agents in the film represent the parents of trans people, gatekeepers, and cisgender society in general, pushing back against any gender non-conformity. Through most of the movie, Trinity represents the trans community, encouraging visibility and representation so that trans eggs can find themselves. In this scene, the cops/parents are saying to the agents "we've got this, we can keep our trans child from discovering who they are" and Smith is telling them "you have already failed, the child you thought you knew is gone." Trans kids were never their assigned gender, they are trans regardless of if they know or not.

</div>

Gatekeepers do everything they can to stand in the way of gender transitions, throwing up barriers and hoops to be jumped through at every turn in order to not only keep trans people from defying their birth assignment, but also enforcing restrictions to make transition as hard as possible. Regardless, trans people always find a way, we perform sheer feats of strength to become who we really are, accomplishing the impossible.

<a href="../03.jpeg" class="card left span3"><img src="../03.jpeg" alt="JONES: The informant is real. SMITH: Yes" class="card-img-top"></a>If you've never heard the term Quisling, I suggest taking a look at [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quisling). It's a term used to refer to someone of a particular minority group which chooses to side with the oppressors in order to increase their prestige with that group. In trans spaces, this usually means a trans person who adopts the language of TERFs and gatekeepers in order to lift themselves above other trans people. "Look at me, I'm better than those other people, love me instead."

Trans quislings severely hinder trans acceptance and progression of trans rights by reinforcing the opinions of the oppressors. Becoming such a person requires an intense amount of internalized transphobia and often an unhealthy dose of internalized misogyny. Commonly these people become deeply entrenched in [The Manosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere) (aka, the Red Pill Movement), a mens rights network centering around certain high profile misogynists and anti-feminists such as Jordan Peterson or Ben Shapiro.

One of the most well known quislings is the irredeemable Blair White, a youtuber who has sided with conservatives and MRAs in order to make a name and career for herself. Blair declared herself as "no longer trans" two years into her transition, strongly subscribes to [transmedicalist idologies](http://sjwiki.org/wiki/Truscum), and has demonstrated herself to be a white supremacist on multiple occasions. I actually learned of her three months before my own shell cracked, and was absolutely mortified that such a person could exist.

Here we see Neo searching the internet, trying to find Morpheus, knowing that Morpheus has the answers he seeks.

The Internet opened up a massive gateway to trans support. Before the web exploded into mainstream use, information on trans identities was extremely hard to find and was largely religated to in-person support groups. The web was the great equalizer, however, and suddenly a wealth of data became available at your fingertips. One of the largest sites for this in the late 90s was Susan's Place, an online forum [which launched in 1995](https://planettransgender.com/susans-place-founder-susan-larson-comes-out/). If you searched google for transgender resources, Susan's Place was on page one. Even today, searching for most trans topics will still yield links forum threads on the site.

Unfortunately, the site also tends to enable some of the less palatable sides of the trans community. I found Susan's Place when I was 16, and the conversations it held at the time only further reinforced my beliefs that my gender feelings were a fetish that I should be ashamed of. This is still sadly true of the site today, many of the site's patrons demonstrate fetishistic views on gender and transition. Thankfully, there are many other much higher ranked resources available now which are more accepting of different trans narratives, and those were the sites I found when I returned to google in 2017, sitting at a cluttered desk not that dissimilar to Neo's.

Incidentally, the song playing on Neo's headphones in this scene is Massive Attack's [Dissolved Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lcZ0redg1s). [Read the lyrics](https://genius.com/Massive-attack-dissolved-girl-lyrics), this song resonates heavily with being trans.

</div>

Unless you're completely oblivious, you probably picked up on the anagram of Neo and One, Morpheus's name for their Messiah.

The root of Neo, however, is greek, and simply means "new". As a prefix it denotes a refreshing or revived take on something old. A new person, a new life, a new perspective, a new existence. Many trans folk feel like their transitions are a reboot on life, becoming a completely new person, woken up anew.

The statement is not just a command to Neo, it's a command to the viewer.  Wake up neo.

Because of complications and challenges with obtaining licensed hormone therapy, some trans people are forced to turn towards black market sources. This was especially true in the 90s, when the requirements for recognizing gender dysphoria were so much stricter. Even today it is quite common for people to turn to "DIY" HRT, purchasing the hormones from foreign pharmacies. Guides exist all over the web to teach people how to self-medicate safely (there's even a subreddit for it). The downside is that this tends to take a lot more money (both because there is no health insurance involved, and because dealers mark up the price significantly), and is usually done through dark channels.

  <a href="../07-3.jpeg"><img src="../07-3.jpeg" alt="NEO: Ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or dreaming?"></a>
</div>

This is the first set of references in the film to Depersonalization and Derealization, mental states where the mind disconnects from the body and the world around it. If you've ever found yourself feeling like the life you walk through isn't real, like it's all a facsimile, that is derealization. I remember having both of these feelings extremely strongly as a teenager.

My depersonalization came in the form of having no interest in the preservation of condition of my own body. It was just a sack of flesh there to keep myself alive, a host for the symbiote that is my brain. I didn't care how fat I got, how bad my skin was, I didn't even care if I had food on my face. The body wasn't mine. My derealization manifested in a constant sensation that the world didn't actually exist, it was just an illusion, either being fed directly to my brain via some kind of device, or a construct that existed purely to surround me, ala The Truman Show. Life was just a dream, and I was moving through it with no idea where I was going. I could not imagine my life five years into the future because I had no connection to my life in the present.

The Matrix deals **_heavily_** in DPDR concepts, which I'll point out later on.

The two conditions tend to come hand in hand, and are _extremely common_ with transgender people. It is a result of the brain trying to deal with a hormone profile that it isn't designed for. It cannot handle the stress of the environment it is existing in, so it detaches, cuts itself off, convincing itself that nothing is real. DPDR almost universally is the first symptom to vanish after starting hormone therapy, usually within days. Zinnia Jones [has written extensively](https://genderanalysis.net/depersonalization/) about DPDR on her blog, and I highly recommend reading what she has to say.

</div>

Before the Internet made the world a whole lot smaller, the vast majority of the trans community existed as an underbelly in queer and kink spaces. Trans support groups advertised in the back of BDSM magazines, and many people would express their gender feelings through kink organizations. It was extremely common for closeted trans women to develop alternate lives in these spaces and live under pseudonyms. As the Internet became mainstream, many of these communities moved into digital forums, where people continued to only use their chosen names in those spaces.

The song playing in this scene is [Rob Zombie's Dragula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqQuihD0hoI), a song that is believed to be autobiographical about his days driving around with his buddies in his hearse, which was named Dragula. The verse that plays during this scene, however, has a potent meaning in a trans context.

> Dead I am the one, exterminating son   
> Slipping through the trees, strangling the breeze   
> Dead I am the sky, watching angels cry   
> While they slowly turn, conquering the worm

  <a href="../09-3.jpeg"><img src="../09-3.jpeg" alt="TRINITY: Most guys do."></a>
</div>

Do I have to explain this? I mean, there's the obvious factors here of how in the 90s many men believed there were "no girls on the internet", there's also the implication of how many people are surprised when a trans woman comes out because "[they had always seemed so manly](/p/047AE7/the-parts-we-play/)".

<div class="grid-row">
  <a href="../10-1.jpeg"><img src="../10-1.jpeg" alt="TRINITY: I know why you're here, Neo."></a>
  <a href="../10-2.jpeg"><img src="../10-2.jpeg" alt="TRINITY: I know what you've been doing"></a>
  <a href="../10-3.jpeg"><img src="../10-3.jpeg" alt="TRINITY: I know, because I was once looking for the same thing."></a>
</div>

Trinity knows what Neo's pain is like, she's had it before, she can see it on his face. He needs release from his inner torment, same as she did, and she can help him find it.

<div class="grid-row">
  <a href="../11-1.jpeg"><img src="../11-1.jpeg" alt="External shot of the building Neo works in, a METACORTEX sign stretching vertically along its exterior"></a>
  <a href="../11-2.jpeg"><img src="../11-2.jpeg" alt="RINEHEART: You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson."></a>
  <a href="../11-3.jpeg"><img src="../11-3.jpeg" alt="RINEHEART: You believe that you are special, that the rules do not apply to you."></a>
</div>

Neo works for a company named Metacortex. Meta, meaning "self-referential" and Cortex being the outer layer of the brain which houses conscious thought and human identity. Transition involves a deep introspection of who you are and how you interact with the world, as well as an interrogation of your past behaviors and present desires.

Neo is a programmer who has difficulty meshing with the established organizational structures. Trans deviation from social norms is seen as some kind of selfishness by gatekeepers and cishets who are comfortable within their society. We upset them, because they don't understand why we can't just "be normal", follow the rules, and stop acting so special.

Now, in the 90s this wasn't as common, so I can't call this an intentional link, but today the number one trade for trans women is software engineering or other computer related careers. It's astounding just how over represented trans women are in technology. The tech industry is full of social outcasts, people who didn't fit into molds. The freaks and geeks, as it were, were strongly drawn to computer jobs because they had low requirements for socializing, and interpersonal problems were practically the norm. This is the perfect nesting ground for trans eggs. Personally, computing gave me the opportunity to escape, to zone out and stop thinking about my life. I could delve into a problem and become absorbed by it, leaving my physical body behind. It was freeing.

<a href="../03.jpeg" class="card span3" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="../12.jpeg" alt="RINEHEART: The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson." class="card-img-top"></a>Neo is up against a wall. He hates this existence, he hates the world he is in, but he feels like he doesn't have a real choice about how to continue. His only option is to follow the requirements set for him by society. Conform, or be cast out.

<div class="grid-row">
  <a href="../13-1.jpeg"><img src="../13-1.jpeg" alt="MESSENGER: Thomas Anderson?"></a>

  <a href="../14-3.jpeg"><img src="../14-3.jpeg" alt="MORPHEUS: I can guide you, but you must do exactly as I say."></a>
</div>

Through most of this film, Morpheus takes on the role of a transmom, a trans woman that guides other trans women through acceptance and transition. Morpheus tells Neo what he needs to know to figure out who he really is, and guides him on the path to taking control of his life.

Transmoms were very important back in the 90s and earlier, because getting treatment for gender dysphoria was exceptionally difficult. The [requirements for transition](/p/25BF97/a-trans-explosion/) were extremely strict, which meant that a lot of trans women were required to lie to their therapists and doctors in order to obtain treatment. Transmoms would instruct other trans women, coaching them on what to say at these appointments in order to hit the checkmarks that would open up the gates. If you deviated from the script, or faltered in your delivery, the gatekeeper would sense the deception, and you would be banned from any further therapy.

As of this writing only 15 states in the U.S. ban [Conversion Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy) programs, plus an additional 51 cities (counting the District of Columbia). Outside of those places, including the state I grew up in (Michigan), it is still fully legal to force an individual into programs designed to enforce cisgender and heterosexual behavior in children and adults. These programs typically involve practices tantamount to torture. Not only do the programs not work (one study found that 88% of surviving participants return to their natural inclinations), many subjects do not leave the programs alive.

Breaking away from the cisgender heternormative lives that we grow up with is extremely hard, even painful. These principles are taught to us from the moment we can speak and we're surrounded with people who never question their position in these spaces. Even just realizing that one is gay is hard enough, but defying your assigned gender... it feels like insanity. Yet, the feelings persist, and we keep returning to it over and over again. We're left wondering why we are so strange, why we have been cursed with this affliction. Why can't we just be "normal"? We can't control if we're transgender, it just happens.

Many trans people give up, we try as hard as possible to forget, to ignore our feelings and to just live a normal life in the frameworks laid before us. We hide our heads in the sand and pray it will go away if we just do what we're told to do. We look across the chasm, we see an escape, but we are too afraid, the path is too dangerous, so we turn back.

</div>

Social transition is often a very late step in the process for a lot of us. At home we live as ourselves and dress we wish, but when we go to work or even just leave the house at all, we switch into our former presentation. We call this living part-time, two lives constantly vying for existence. Sometimes this is because we're not ready to start hormone therapy, sometimes it's because we want to give the hormones time to do their thing before coming out. Sometimes it's because we can never socially transition, remaining trapped between two worlds.

<div class="grid-row">
  <a href="../18-1.jpeg"><img src="../18-1.jpeg" alt="SMITH: One of these lives..."></a>
  <a href="../18-2.jpeg"><img src="../18-2.jpeg" alt="SMITH: ...has a future."></a>
  <a href="../18-3.jpeg"><img src="../18-3.jpeg" alt="SMITH: And one of them does not."></a>
</div>

Living part time is exhausting. Personally, I would often go through 4-6 outfit changes a day, because I just could not stand to continue to wear my old clothing when I didn't have to. I'd walk through the front door of my house and make a beeline for my closet, pulling off the t-shirt as I went. The pain of then having to put those clothes back on, either because a family member was coming over or because I had to leave the house... it was like having to put on a 50 pound backpack. The push to want to come out of the closet as soon as possible is intense, the old life eventually has to end.

Aside from the mathematics part, this describes me to a T.

In the United States the primary method means of obtaining trans hormone therapy is via informed consent clinics. The clinics hand you a document that you must sign stating that you understand that the therapy you are seeking is considered experimental and has potential risks. You also often will need to have a letter from a licensed therapist stating that you have been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and are recommended for hormone treatment in order to relieve your symptoms. Without these things, most doctors will not be willing to prescribe hormones to you. They're too afraid of exposing themselves to litigation. Even with these things, many prescribing doctors are still extremely conservative with their dosages, often only being willing to start on very low doses and sometimes keeping their patients at or below cis female normal levels (early transition works better with higher levels because you have to counteract the first puberty).

<div class="grid-row">
  <a href="../22-1.jpeg"><img src="../22-1.jpeg" alt="TRINITY: Please, Neo, you have to trust me."></a>
  <a href="../22-2.jpeg"><img src="../22-2.jpeg" alt="NEO: Why?  TRINITY: Because you have been down that road."></a>
  <a href="../22-3.jpeg"><img src="../22-3.jpeg" alt="TRINITY: You know exactly where it ends."></a>
</div>

Walking away from therapy and treatment means continuing down the path of repressed feelings and suppressed self. It means staying in hiding, staying in the dream world. That road is a dead end, quite literally.

</div>

The bug represents internalized transphobia, preventing us from accepting who we are and/or accepting that other trans people as just like us and just as valid as us. Transphobia is instilled in everyone from childhood, our media is drenched in it, and in all likelihood we grew up with family members who reinforced those stigmas. We have to shed these beliefs before we can accept ourselves and move forward with transition.

"Not like this"

In the original script for The Matrix, the character of Switch was supposed to be transgender. Inside the matrix she appeared as she is seen in the film with a female memory resident self image, but in the real world she was physically male. Thus, her name, Switch. Warner Brothers rejected the character design, and the Wachowskis chose to keep her female on both sides.

Switch's line here, "not like this", is a representation of how so many closeted trans people reach a place where they see their own mortality and realize they cannot die in their assigned gender.
