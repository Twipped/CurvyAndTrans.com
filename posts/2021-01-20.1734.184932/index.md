Most everyone I came out to in my first year were astonished at my gender identity, largely because they had always seen me as completely masculine. I had learned very hard lessons as a teenager that feminine expression was not tolerated from me, and had to be suppressed. With that suppression also came a number of toxic attitudes and personality traits that I am not at all proud of.

But as OP says here, none of it was internalized. What WAS internalized was the ways that society is so horrifically unfair to women, because I could relate so well to the women around me, and embracing feminism was a major stepping stone to shedding that masculine veneer.

But doing so took time. There’s a reason I waited a year and a half before I started my Instagram. That first year of shedding the masking and acclimating to women’s spaces was awkward as fuck, and in some places quite painful.

There’s a photo from the first company holiday party where I went as myself that I cannot stand to look at because I stood out so harshly from the other women in the company. Not just because of what I was wearing but also because I still carried myself like a man.

Nearly every transfemme more than two years in can tell you about their awkward princess phase (and I’m sure transmascs have their own version as well). The stereotypes of men in dresses all stem from this stage of transition, when we are most uncomfortable and most obvious, struggling to all the things we weren’t allowed to learn as teenagers.

Please afford baby transes some space, they wouldn’t be in this place if they had been given the opportunities to do this younger.
