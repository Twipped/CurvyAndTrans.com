Todays outfit is one of my favorite outfits, but I haven’t worn it in a while because photos never do it justice: the dress is best seen in motion, but I didn’t have time to do a video, so hopefully these photos will catch it. The dress is off Amazon, made by 12 Ami, a two tone “denim” patterned maxi dress with a handkerchief hem line. It billows and flows in the most delightful way, and... IT HAS POCKETS! Over it I’m wearing a Zeagoo sleeveless cardigan vest in navy blue.

The downside (or upside, depending on your view) is that this outfit completely hides all of my curves.

My face is very fuzzy today because I have an appointment for laser hair removal tonight. After 10 sessions, my tech always wants me to have enough growth so she can see what areas need targeting the hardest.
