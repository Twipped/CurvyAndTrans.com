It was raining all through my therapy session this morning, and when I stepped outside afterwards I saw the drops clinging to the plants around the pond and felt compelled to do some macro photography to calm my mind.

We started a memory from my childhood that immediately jumped to the fight I had with my boss earlier this year. The two events are very closely connected in my memory, even tho there is 25 years between them, and this session explained why that fight hit me so hard. His anger triggered old trauma.

Trauma which may itself go back even further to my dad. Itâ€™s hard to say because most of those memories of my father are still locked up tight, but there were definitely echoes of him in the memory.

EMDR can be such a trip.
