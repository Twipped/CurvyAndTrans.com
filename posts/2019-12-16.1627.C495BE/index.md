I’ll be honest, if it wasn’t for how amazing this cat-eye came out today, I’m not sure I would have posted this set. It’s been kind of a meh day, and my outfit reflected that. I’ve started experimenting with a liquid white eyeliner and omg is it tricky to work with. It’s like putting whiteout on your face.

One little star was this nice set of wedge pumps that I found at Nordstrom Rack this morning. I’ve been in pretty sad need of a pump shoe for a long time, but most of the ones I’ve encountered were much too tall of a heel for my weak ankles to handle. This pair is just an inch and a half, so they should be a great addition to my closet.

Still need to find a good wide-calf knee high boot.
