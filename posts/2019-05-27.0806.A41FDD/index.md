Itâ€™s Memorial Day, and I ainâ€™t leaving the house at all until my laser hair removal appointment this evening (my face is a mess of two day stubble). The children are driving us nuts, we made it until 9am before deploying the iPads, and I broke out our emergency puzzle.

> Once more into the breach,   
> to burn the darkness upon my cheeks.   
> Free me from this vile curse,   
> by fire let the hair be purged.
