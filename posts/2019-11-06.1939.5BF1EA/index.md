### **BIG DAMN CONTENT WARNING**

***THIS POST IS NOT SAFE FOR WORK***

The question above was posed to me today, and the answer is just too large for a twitter thread, so I figure I might as well write about it here. **The following descriptions are based on my own experience and are not universal, different people experience sex drive differently.**

I never actually experienced a total drop out of libido, so this will likely differ from some people. Instead, what happened was a new kind of libido grew over top of it, and for several weeks I didn't realize what it was I was experiencing. Getting horny on estrogen is a totally different experience. Some of this is probably going to sound like a corny romance novel, and believe me, that's exactly what was running through my head when I first realized what was happening. It feels so cliche, but it's totally legit.

It starts with a quickened pulse. My breathing gets heavier and I can tell my pupils have dilated. My chest will get warm and extremely sensitive to touch, and I'll be compelled to touch it with my own fingers. Just grazing my skin feels delightful, my erogenous zones are alive with activity, and I'll feel a longing to have my breasts held and my neck kissed. That longing develops into an ache, and I'll start to get desperate for human touch.

My groin starts to ache as well, but not in the way it felt like on testosterone. T Libido made my penis get hard and would cause my testicles to swell; all of the excitement would be front-loaded in the groin. With an estrogenic libido it's much deeper then that, the ache settles into my perineum and the back of my scrotal cavity, [where my vagina would be](../3.jpeg). This will be accompanied with moisture along the penile shaft, which typically comes with an increase of odor. I get hit with a longing for pressure against my pelvis, a desire to be filled.

As arousal builds I feel it in my torso. It's like a spring running from my groin, through my abdomen and chest, and into my head. The more turned on I get, the tighter the spring becomes. If I engage in sexual activity, this tension continues to build, and its release is what fires off my orgasm. I never experienced anything like this while on testosterone. T Libido had an orgasm largely building in the crotch until it exploded forward. Estrogen orgasms are more like an energy surge that builds in your body and then fires the entire burst from your brain to your groin. A big orgasm will cause that energy to ricochet up and down your body, hitting every nerve along the way and causing you to convulse and spasm. And then, there is no refractory period, I'm left in a state in bliss, wanting more, rather than feeling spent and sad from an oxytocin surge.

Where T Libido compelled me to pursue my love interest like a predator, E Libido made me want to *be* pursued and pinned like prey.

Where T Libido made me feel like I was being dragged towards my interest by my penis, E Libido makes me feel like I was being magnetically pulled towards them in the chest.

Where T Libido made me get hard in excitement, E Libido makes my breasts swell in desire.

The part that sucks, and ultimately the part that made me realize what it was that I was experiencing, is how it feels if you are not able to meet these needs. Denial of this desire feels like abject rejection of the worst kind. If my partner is not in the mood, all that excitement dumps into heartache, and I become extremely depressed. It was when I observed myself having this feeling that I connected it to things my wife had said in the past about how it felt when she was horny and I wasn't interested, and suddenly all the pieces came together.

In spite of that, however, I still absolutely love this entire experience, and that just cements to me how much oh a woman I really am. I've talked to trans guys who hated this feeling, because it just felt alien to them. To me, it's exactly the way it always should have been, and it explains why I always struggled with sexual desire pre-transition.
