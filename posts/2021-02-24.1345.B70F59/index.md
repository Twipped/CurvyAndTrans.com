[@DameKraft](https://twitter.com/DameKraft) did a fantastic thread today about how a lot of trans people may be concluding that they are cisgender because their incongruence is not strong enough to feel like they have a right to identify as transgender.  Firstly: YES YOU ARE TRANS ENOUGH.

Secondly, there is no such thing as "appropriating" being trans. I know how easy it is to fall into this trap, because before my own wakeup call I also was afraid to ever mention my feelings around my gender because I thought it would be insensitive or appropriative of "actual" trans people. That's bullshit! If you do not feel a *strong* connection to your birth assigned gender, you're trans!

It doesn't matter if the world still thinks you're cis. You still know who you are, the people who know you know who you are, and that isn't invalidated simply because you haven't "transgressed" cisgender norms.

A couple years ago Ada Powers did a fantastic thread about how mixed pronouns work, which partly forked off into a conversation on gender expression. I've extracted the relevant pieces below, but [the entire thread](https://twitter.com/mspowahs/status/1192192265898336257?s=20) is worth exploring.
