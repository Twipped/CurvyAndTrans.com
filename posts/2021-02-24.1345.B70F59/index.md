[@DameKraft](https://twitter.com/DameKraft) did a fantastic thread today about how a lot of trans people may be concluding that they are cisgender because their incongruence is not strong enough to feel like they have a right to identify as transgender.  Firstly: YES YOU ARE TRANS ENOUGH.

Secondly, there is no such thing as “appropriating” being trans. If you do not feel a strong connection to your assigned gender, you can call yourself trans! You aren’t offending anyone (at least, anyone whose opinion matters).

I know how easy it is to fall into this trap, because before my own wakeup call I also was afraid to ever mention my feelings around my gender. I thought it would be insensitive or appropriative of “actual” trans people. It’s laughable when I think of that now.

It doesn't matter if the world still thinks you're cis, you know who you are, the people who know you know who you are, and that isn't invalidated simply because you haven't "transgressed" cisgender norms.

Ada Powers did a fantastic thread a few years back about how mixed pronouns work, which partly forked off into a conversation on gender expression across the cis/trans divide. I've extracted the relevant pieces below, but [the entire thread](https://twitter.com/mspowahs/status/1192192265898336257?s=20) is worth exploring.
