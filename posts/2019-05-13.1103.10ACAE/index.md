How do I love this body? Let me count the ways;
From cheek down to cheek, from toe up to head.
In curve of back and roundness of butt,
In fullness of breast and eyes full of love.

This body has been torn and bruised,
it has been bloated and consumed.

Injected, medicated,
blood drawn, dehydrated,
Hypoglycemic
And left anemic.

No bones broken,
But some organs stolen
Hormones changed and rearranged
Fat shifted, burned and then gained

It has caused me pain and depressionâ€¦
Dysphoric recollections
Changes said and done
And changes yet to come.

But now today I can look in a mirror and say
This body of mine is beautiful,
And I own it in every way.
