Ten years ago this wonderful woman and I said I Do. She’s still as gorgeous today as she was then (and I got a whole hell of a lot prettier). I thought then that I knew what love is, but it has grown so much since that day.

It’s been an extraordinary decade full of devotion, laughter, losses, surprises, evolutions, blessings, growth and joy. We’ve both changed so much from who we were back then, but our love remained strong through thick and thin.

Happy Anniversary, Katharine. I love you with all of my heart.

❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
