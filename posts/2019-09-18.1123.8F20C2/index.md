This outfit is inspired by San Diego's truly stunning sunsets, which I often forget to watch out for. Once in a while I’ll happen to be out of the house at that moment of perfection when the sky bursts into oranges, pinks and purples, and I’ll be reminded how much I take for granted just how beautiful this place I live really is.

The last pic in this set is a play on a meme I saw yesterday about one of Stanley Kubrick’s signature shots, a forward shot on the main character with their head tilted forward as they leer at the camera. The shot is designed to show that the character is reaching the peak of their derangement.

> Mad, am I? There is always some madness in love. There is also reason in the madness, and it is sometimes an appropriate response to reality, to go a little bit insane.
