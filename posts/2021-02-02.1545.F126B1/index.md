I’ve been in love with the show Warrior Nun this past year, on Netflix. One of my favorite characters is Chanel (played by May Lifschitz), who is trans. Her being trans is incidental, she’s just another secondary character, there to support the main character. There is only one point in the show, during a character building moment for the main character, that they reference the fact she’s trans, and you wouldn’t even catch it if you didn’t know thats what they meant.

Chanel’s being trans is not her defining piece. She could have been cis and it wouldn’t have changed the story.

That is how you write a trans character. Make it incidental, just another piece of who they are as a person. And for the love of god, cast a trans person in the role!!
