Back in January I went to Torrid armed with giftcards from Christmas. I bought a bunch of tops, but had enough money for one dress. It came down to two choices, and I ended up selecting that black and pink lacy spaghetti strap dress that I’ve worn a bunch in the last few months.

This was the other dress. Last week I cashed out my [Poshmark](https://www.poshmark.com) balance and knew instantly what I wanted to buy with it. Good thing I did too, because it was on clearance!

I’ve avoided off the shoulder dresses, largely because I don’t have a strapless bra and haven’t felt comfortable going out without a bra, but back in October I bought an off the shoulder maxi dress that has become one of my top ten dresses, and that made me more comfortable with visible straps.

I actually spent half the day NOT wearing a bra under this dress after the straps started digging into my armpit at lunch. I don’t think I’m likely to make a habit of it, but I felt completely fine because the waist of the dress held everything up.

I’m peeved about how badly overlined by lip color was, but I was really pleased with my eye makeup.
