Final Elomi purchase of the year, the Jodi. It’s giving me good lift and frontal projection, and the stretch lace along the top is SUPER soft and comfy. However, it doesn’t quite shape my breasts as well as Sachi or Morgan do, and with only three hooks the band isn’t tall enough to keep my side fat from pouring over the top of the band. I definitely recommend it, but I’m going to return it; I don’t really need another bra of this type, and it feels like it’s designed for a fuller breast shape than I have. I love the fabric and color, it’s a very light weight and fairly comfortable bra, but I can tell I won’t wear it much.
