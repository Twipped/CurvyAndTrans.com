“But the fantasy!” Seriously tho, lets talk about that fantasy. Lets talk about sex, baby. Content warning: Genitals, anatomy, hormones. This one is gonna get intimate, and hopefully wont run afoul of content filters. This is a Sex Positive post.

Trans porn is selling a lie.

First lets talk about the feminine penis. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) of course involves estrogen, estradiol to be specific, taken several different ways. Take enough E and the body stops producing testosterone on its own, but it takes a lot and doctors are squeamish, so instead they prescribe an anti-androgen to shut down the testicles. That means no semen. Without T the prostate shrinks down to a skene’s gland, and one stops getting random erections (and there was much rejoicing). Ejaculate becomes clear, and often times dries up entirely.

Without those random erections the phallus starts to atrophy, and in short order you have a short order. Erections are still possible, but they become painful, as the corpus spongiosum has deteriorated. Regular “exercise” can restore it to working order, but many trans women don’t want to exercise it (myself included). On top of this, switching from T to E causes skin to soften and thin, including there. Friction along the shaft and head produces tears in the skin, so penetration without significant amounts of lube becomes painful quickly. The glans itself also becomes much more sensitive.

Basically what I’m saying is, the penis turns into an oversized clit, with all the advantages and disadvantages there in. For many of us, this is a positive change, because we don’t enjoy using it as a dick anyway. Penis in vagina sex gives many of us dysphoria. (Note, I say many here, not all. If you’re a trans girl reading this and you like PiV, awesome! Not only are you valid, you’re lucky!) It still feels good, physically (until the pain kicks in), but the experience is wrong. Sex for my part has become much more lesbian (can I use that as an adjective?), with more grinding, fingering, oral, and a lot more foreplay. I enjoy intimacy much more than I used to. This is true for most of the trans women I know, if they’re even having sex at all.

This is where the lie resides in porn. The vast majority of mainstream pornography featuring trans women has them acting in a male role, fully erect, penetrating their partner and/or masturbating by stroking, and typically firing off a white load. If you ever see a trans woman doing this, she is off her meds, and probably has been for a month or two. For many of us our medication is our most precious property, we horde it like dragons (seriously, I have a two year supply of E). The only reason we ever stop taking it is because we’re desperate.

Sex work, if you’re able to do it, can be quite lucrative, and a lot of trans performers are just doing it to save up for one or more surgeries (again, not all, Bailey Jay being a notable exception). It’s so lucrative that it’s worth enduring menopause multiple times (have to keep going back on HRT to maintain that girlish figure) as well as the dysphoria of running on Testosterone while also performing a sex act that you probably don’t actually enjoy. “Ok, Jocelyn, so how do I find authentic trans porn?” Chaturbate is the easiest source, tho it is very performer dependent. The best way, tho, is to pay for it. Crash Pad Series is FANTASTIC and well worth their subscription. Pink Label TV is also well known for being queer authentic, as is Indie Porn Revolution. Pro-Tip: if the site uses trans slurs like Trap, Shemale, or Tranny, it is not a trans positive site.

Looking at you, XHamster.
