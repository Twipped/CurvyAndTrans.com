And if by some magic I manage to get myself productive during this dead time, I will then hyper-fixate and *forget about the appointment.*

It also hits me if I’m just responsible for watching my kids that day. The simple fact that I am the one to pay attention to them will keep me from even being able to *think* about work. Even if they’re off watching TV and completely disengaged from me.
