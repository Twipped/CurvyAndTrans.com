One does not need to have Gender Dysphoria to be Transgender, but a lot of people think they don't have it when they do.

Gender Dysphoria isn’t only measured by pain, it can also manifest as joy. If you’ve found yourself saying “I don’t have dysphoria, I just feel better when people use neutral pronouns” or “Crossdressing makes me feel sexy” or “I’m just happier when people see me as a man”, those are all manifestations of gender dysphoria.

You have gender dysphoria!
