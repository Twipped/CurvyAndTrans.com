Well it isn’t done yet, because Amazon isn’t delivering my new light until 10pm, but my vanity overhaul is pretty well established. Swipe to see the before.

I need to go back to Ikea to return some stuff, so I’ll get more peg shelves and a hanging trash can to replace that ugly blue basket. Pretty much everything here is @ikeausa except for the main shelf, which is just a finished board I bought at Home Depot.
