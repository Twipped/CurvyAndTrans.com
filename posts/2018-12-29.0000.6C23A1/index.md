Do you ever wake up in the morning and just need to feel sexy today? Not for anyone else, just for yourself, for your own sense of self worth? Today was one of those days. My wife says I looked like a sex kitten walking around the house this morning (after I put on a skirt, I don’t usually walk around my children in my underwear). I never understood how good it feels to feel sexy. I mean, I imagined it, but I didn’t really understand it for myself until about three months ago. I especially never thought I could love my midriff as much as I do now. I really enjoy just wearing a bralette or a swim top with a skirt and kimono, it’s such a freeing experience.

Self love is awesome!
