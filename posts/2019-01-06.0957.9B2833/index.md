I have become the cool aunt that knows you know better but enables you all the same.

I love this new kimono that I got yesterday from Shein. It fits straight into my diva aesthetic. Ill have to lose it later tho, I have to take down the Christmas lights today.

My son loves these leggings, he keep grabbing my legs just to feel the texture.
