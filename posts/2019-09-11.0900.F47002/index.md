That feel when you don’t realize how transparent your outfit is until you start to process the photos an hour later and can see your underwear... Oh well, work is providing lunch, so at least I don’t have to go out in daylight.

I was trying to go for a bit of a clammy look for Witchy Wednesday. Not sure if I pulled it off.
