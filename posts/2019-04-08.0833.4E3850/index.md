I was feeling rather sassy this morning. For a lark I decided to do my makeup the way I used to do it about a year ago, and the result was so nice that it put me in a good mood.

I haven’t posted much in the last week. My period hit me pretty hard this time around and not only was my dysmorphia sky high, sending my body confidence in to the dumpster, I just had zero motivation to put the effort into a post. I have a cute outfit from last Wednesday that I never even color corrected. I haven’t hardly even been looking at social media because I was just feeling too sensitive.

It all cleared out yesterday and I’m back to feeling myself again. It was early 90°F in San Diego today, and that calls for sun dresses.
