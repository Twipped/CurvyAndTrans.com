    <p>the thing about being someone who’s never catcalled is that you start to wonder why like is it because im ugly???</p>

    <p>and then you realize that youre judging your worth by whether or not you are objectifiable to a man and thats so fucked up like honestly its so fucked up</p>

    <p>but the worst part about the patriarchy is that it still sits at the back of your mind regardless like “nobody thinks youre pretty because they dont see you as a sex object” like somehow thats a desirable thing and it fucks me up</p>

[@gratefully_gen](https://instagram.com/gratefully_gen) shared an image of this Tumblr post in her Instagram stories and I appreciated the post so much that I went looking for [the original](https://thiscrookedcrown.tumblr.com/post/167653546231/bigbardafree-the-thing-about-being-someone).

I have been in this mental space so many times, and it messes with you so much. I never get any male attention when I’m out and about in the world, I am invisible to them. Women notice me, because of how I dress, but that alone doesn’t draw the male gaze, and I’ve considered the causes of that many times. I don’t WANT that attention, I’m actually very thankful that I don’t have to deal with that every day, but still I feel its void.

And that is so fucked up! That harassment from men should be such a normal part of womanhood that I note it’s absence and see it as a judgment of myself is just wrong on so many levels! My worth has absolutely NOTHING to so with how desirable I am to men, but I’ve absorbed this patriarchal behavior so well that I cannot help but feel low for it.

Fuck men, fuck the patriarchy, and fuck measuring my womanhood with the objectification of assholes.
