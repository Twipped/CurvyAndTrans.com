### Prelude: Summer of 1987, I am six years old.

<a href="../2.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../2.jpeg" alt="" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">My Grandmother kissing my face at the 1981 Jehovah's Witness District Convention, Pontiac Michigan.</span></a>I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. My mother, my father, my grandmother, one of my uncles, his wife, and two of my three cousins are Witnesses. My entire social circle growing up was JWs. The only life I knew until my 20s was in the JW faith.

Back then the JWs had three yearly events: two circuit assemblies and one big district convention. Our district convention was held in the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan (a district of Detroit). The DC is a big deal, it's one of the largest social events of the year. Since the JW faith prioritizes friendships and relationships within the church (very strongly discouraging extra-faith association), these are often the biggest opportunities for meeting new friends and for single people to find romantic interests. Thus, everybody always wears their finest (tho not too ostentatious, must remain modest and humble). That year, my mother had sewn for me a five piece child's suit. It was navy blue with vertical pin stripes, single breasted, double button, notched lapel jacket, a matching waistcoat, and shorts (because it's July in Michigan in a very large football stadium), worn over a white button up shirt with a clip on tie. I imagine I looked like quite the dapper five year old boy.

I hated that suit. I hated the way it fit my body, I hated the way it made me hot, I hated how I felt when I wore it. It constricted me when I moved, binding in my shoulders and groin, making it harder to run. It was just wrong, it felt wrong on my body. Most of my friends at the time were girls, partly because that's just how our congregation was, but also because I never got along well with any boys my age. All my friends were wearing beautiful dresses, had bows in their long hair, and just looked really pretty. That's what I wanted too; I wanted to be pretty. I remember resenting anyone who ever told me I looked handsome. I hated that word.

### A Babe With Two Names

I was born one month premature on October 9th, 1980, delivered by cesarean due to preeclampsia. My parents could not decide on what to name me; my father preferred the name Jarvis, but my mother wanted the name Jordan. Apparently they hadn't been putting much discussion into the topic, because my mom says they decided on these names the day I was born. I asked her what name she would have gone with had I been born female, but she didn't have an answer. Unable to reach an agreement, they went with both, and I was given the name Jarvis-Jordan Allen Badgley (Allen being my father's name). My Dad and all of his family always called me Jarvis, but my mother and her family called me Jory (one of my uncles still to this day calls me JJ). Within the JW congregation, it was split, with most of the women and kids also calling me Jory, and most of the men calling me Jarvis (how patriarchal).

At the age of four I decided that I didn't like the name Jordan, and I definitely didn't like the name Jory; it didn't fit me right. I believe my reasoning at the time was that it was boring and the name Jarvis was much more unique and interesting (and Jory was infantizing). I suspect I may have also felt that Jarvis was less masculine, by virtue of being less common (this might just me be projecting my current feelings, however). I told everyone that I knew that I wanted to be called Jarvis from then on. Some people resisted it, but most accepted my choice, including my mother, despite being sad that I had sided with my father.

<a href="../3.jpeg" class="card left span5"><img src="../3.jpeg" alt="Me in my backyard, playing with a set of deer antlers." class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Fall, 1982</span></a>When I was five years old one of my friends, a girl born the same month as me, suddenly didn't want to play with me any more. I couldn't understand why, I was worried that I had hurt her feelings some how, that I had said or did something that had upset her, and I asked my mom what I could have done to cause this. My mom explained that the girl had started attending public school, and that the kids at school believed that boys and girls didn't play together. Since I was a boy, that meant she didn't want to be around me any more.

I was so upset by this, it just didn't make any sense, I didn't see anything about me that was different from her, aside from our age. I knew that boys had penises and that girls didn't, but I didn't see why that mattered. We both enjoyed the same games, we did the same activities, why couldn't we be friends? The experience left me feeling very confused and frustrated; I didn't feel like a boy, I didn't relate to any of the boys I knew, but here I had this significant event which said undeniably that I _was_ a boy, and because of that I was being denied something I wanted very badly. The memory sat on my psyche like a cinder-block and firmly entrenched the idea that, no matter how I felt, I had to be a boy.

I don't remember having any bias in the toys I played with. My mom always prided herself on not reinforcing stereotypes in my play, so I had a pretty wide diversity in toys. I had matchbox cars and Star Wars action figures-- yes, the original figures, the ones that would be worth tons of money today if we still had them. My mother removed the light-sabers that slid out of the arms because I wasn't allowed to have weapons. I also had dolls and a toy kitchen, a Rainbow Brite and Starlite toy that I think we got from a garage sale, and I remember I was really into cabbage patch kids at one point. I also had my fair share of stuffed animals, some of which were homemade. Still to this day I'm quite obsessed with plushies. I played with LEGO a _lot_ and would construct my own ships and buildings to make-believe with, but I never had an interest in sports or really any traditionally masculine activities. My dad was (and still is) a deer hunter and loved his guns and bows, but I never felt much desire to be involved in any of that and never wanted to go hunting with him. I did love to bake, however, and I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with my mother. I also enjoyed sewing, tho I didn't actively pursue it until middle school.

<a href="../1.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../1.jpeg" alt="Me in my backyard with an Australian Shepherd puppy, sitting in tall grass, our house visible behind me." class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Summer, 1986</span></a>My mother describes me as an "Extremely Sensitive" child. From infancy I was very atypical in my behavior, and quickly prone to explosive fits. She tells stories about how women would judge her for carrying me facing forward instead of laying across her shoulder, because I would always get very upset if I couldn't see what was happening. I didn't like to be held in any of the typical ways people hold infants. I was always very quick to emotional outbursts, crying at the drop of a hat, and would have my feelings hurt extremely easily.  Because of this, when it became time for me to start schooling, my mother decided that it would be a very bad idea for me to be put into the local school district.

### Schooled

The area we lived in was predominantly farm country, and farmer kids are... a type. The children in our area were known for being very mean, the school district had a massive bullying problem. It also wasn't well funded, and my mother didn't believe I would receive a good education from those schools.  So, she did something completely radical at the time... she home schooled me. She was the first home schooling parent that school district had even had, the first in any of the neighboring counties, and she wrote to home schooling associations to get help and materials to convince the school district to allow her to do so under regulation and testing.  Consequently, for kindergarten through third grade I was taught at home by my mom.

I don't remember much about how we did this. I know she obtained a school desk from the local university, which I would sit at and do worksheets. I excelled at sciences and reading (I know at 4th grade I tested at a 6th grade reading level), but struggled with writing and maths. I had a very hard time with hand writing, and to this day have dreadful penmanship. I remember that my mom would try to find real world examples of things to help me understand concepts. She also enabled my desire to conduct science experiments and learn how things work (tho she also had plenty of bad stories about this as well).

She obtained a Commodore Vic-20 with a cassette tape drive when I was around 6, and showed me how you could type programs into it and make things happen. I didn't really learn how to program, however, but I loved the computer itself. Around the same time my grandmother bought her first home PC, an IBM PC that she got used from Central Michigan University. It had two 5.75" floppy drives and an orange monochrome screen. I remember playing [Castle Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaKtZYMBbwM) on it, using the arrow keys to move a single character around inside a castle. I believe this was the first computer game I ever played. There probably were some arcade machines in our town at grocery stores or something, but I never got to play them.

### Life in the Country

<a href="../8.jpeg" class="card center"><img src="../8.jpeg" alt="Satallite view of my childhood home" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Present day aerial photography, courtesy of Google Earth.</span></a>

The first ten years of my life were spent in a small three bedroom pre-fabricated house off a dirt road outside Farwell, Michigan, which sat on about 2 acres of land that stretched down a hillside and into the forest behind. Until I was around seven or eight years old, the lot to the south of us was all just empty field. In the spring time the entire field would bloom with thousands of dandelion flowers. My mom would go out and pick the largest flowers she could find, would bread them, and then fry them in oil, creating a crispy snack that was like onion rings. Once the flowers went to seed, the entire field would fill with white clouds as the breeze kicked up the seed puffs.

<a href="../4.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../4.jpeg" alt="" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Winter 1983/84</span></a>Behind the house ran a small stream which cut across the field and through the woods. I spent my days wandering around in the woods behind our house with our family dog along side, chasing toads and trying to catch turtles, overturning rocks to find garter snakes, or sometimes just sitting next to the waters edge and watch water-striders skip across the surface of the still corners of the stream. The creek was mostly wading depth, but if you followed it north to where it went under the road, there was a spot where the water got deep enough to properly swim.

When my mom would have a meal ready she would open the door and call my name, and I'd come running up to the house. Looking back on it, it's like something out of a 60s family TV series. Griffin, our Australian Shepherd, was basically my Lassie. In the winter, parts of the creek would freeze over and I'd go out on the ice. It would inevitably break and I'd fall into the creek and end up running back up the snowy hill completely soaked through my coveralls, but that never kept me from doing it again.

There was a tree in next to the creek that had been hollowed out by wood peckers, and one year a bee hive formed inside it. I remember leaning my head against the tree and hearing the buzzing, and watching the bees pass in and out through the hole in the trunk above my head. One time I got brave enough to climb up the side of the trunk and peer in through the opening, seeing the honeycomb inside. Eventually, though, I became too afraid of anything with a stinger to try something like that again.

Paper Wasps were a common problem in the area, and would build their nests under the eves of our house, or in my dad's work shed. I was stung by wasps more times than I can count. One year I stumbled across a bumble bee nest underground behind our house. Bumble bees, unlike honey bees, do not have barbed stingers, and can sting multiple times without dying. One flew up into my shirt and got stuck, stinging me a total of 21 times on the chest and belly. I remember grinding up aspirin pills and mixing with water to form a paste that we dabbed on each of the stings to take away the pain.

The neighbors to the east of us raised geese, which they allowed to simply roam the country side. The geese weren't very bright, and often would lay their eggs next to the creek. The egg would then roll down the hill and fall into the creek, where it would be kept preserved by the cold water. I would walk along the creek bed and find the eggs, taking them up to my mother to cook.

<a href="../7.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../7.jpeg" alt="Me and my dog sitting in our back yard, with a forest in view behind. A swingset and tricycle are visible in the grass." class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Fall, 1987</span></a>Wild strawberries grew along the edges of the creek, and blackberry bushes bordered the forest edge, giving me great little snacks to find in the spring and summer. We also had a gravenstein apple tree at the edge of the forest at the base of the hill, which I would climb and pull apples off of. Gravenstein apples are far too sour to eat straight, but my mother would use them in pies or jam. Half way down the hill side, next to my swing-set, was a patch of rhubarb, which she would also boil to use in pies and jams. My mother did a lot of her own canning. She also kept a garden in the yard with tomatoes, corn, cucumbers, various herbs, pumpkins and even watermelon. I remember that I would have to help her stretch the frost barrier plastic over the crops when the weather got cold.

My mom also raised chickens. An old chicken cook sat next to my dad's work shed at the base of the hill. It was two parts, with an indoor rooting area and an outdoor enclosure that the chickens could enter at their own will. This got us eggs, and once in a while my mom would decided to make a roasted chicken. She would select one of the hens, slaughter it on the chopping log behind the shed, pluck it, season it, and then roast it in our oven. I had a genuine chicken down pillow on my bed made from the feathers she collected from the hens.

<a href="../5.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../5.jpeg" alt="Me, sitting atop the split wood pile next to our house" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Summer, 1986</span></a>The house was heated by a large wood stove in the livingroom, on the south side of the house. My bedroom was on the north side of the house, so in the winter it was usually pretty cold in my bedroom. I got used to sleeping under multiple layers of thick blankets, the pressure keeping me comfortable. This continues today, tho now I replicate the effect with a weighted blanket. Waking up in the morning and feeling the chill of the room while I was nestled deep under the warm blankets was such a great feeling.

By most people's standards I had an idyllic childhood, but all such stories have a dark side, and that was my father.

<a href="../6.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../6.jpeg" alt="My father and I working in the back yard. I am shirtless and extremely skinny" class="card-img-top"><span class="card-body">Fall, 1986</span></a>My dad is a narcissist and a blatant misogynist, of the "women belong in the kitchen" variety; a full blown woman hater. The type of man that today would be labeled a Men's Rights Activist or an Incel. He was tremendously abusive to my mother, both physically and emotionally. For much of that time my father was a construction worker and usually would stay in hotels near the sites he worked on, so most of the time it was just me and my mom at home. Sometimes he would be dismissed from a work site ahead of schedule and would come home a few days before we expected him. He would go into a rage because there wouldn't be a meal waiting for him on the table, even tho we had no idea he was going to be home.

I know I was frequently afraid of him, and would have anxiety when he was home, but other than that have very few memories of him from these times because I've blocked them all out. None of the memories I do have are pleasant. I remember being hogtied with duct-tape when I would misbehave. I also remember that I always wanted my mother to be the one to spank me when I was bad, because she'd use her hand, or a fly swatter, but my dad would use a belt.

<a href="../9.jpeg" class="card right span4"><img src="../9.jpeg" alt="Newspaper clipping about my father taking down an 8 point deer buck on the opening day of hunting season in 1984" class="card-img-top"></a>My dad is a deer hunter, both with bow and rifle, so every hunting season he would bring home one or two deer. To save money he would skin and dress the carcasses himself, hanging them up from a 10 foot tripod that he built in the back yard out of 4x4 timber. I remember watching as he stripped the skin off the meat and cut open the belly with a large bowie knife, letting the blood and entrails exit out into a bucket beneath the deer. The carcass would then be transported off to a local butcher to be divided into venison steaks and ground meat, which would fill our deep freezer for an entire year (I despise the taste of venison), and the fur would be sold to local fur traders. The offal, however, had to be disposed of in a way that was both clean and wouldn't bring scavengers. For this, my father would choose a location in the yard and dig a 4 foot deep hole to dump the entrails into, covering it up between deer. At the end of the season he would fill the hole back in with dirt.

One time I climbed down into the hole after he had dug it, and then couldn't get back out. I sat in the hole for 10 minutes calling for help before my father found me, and then decided to teach me a lesson. He left me there for another hour before coming back and pulling me out, covered in my own tears. I never again climbed into a hole that I didn't know for certain I could escape from.

As small kids tend to do, I frequently would get in underfoot as he moved about the house. He would yell at me to get out of his way, and if I didn't move fast enough he would move me by force, throwing me across the room or into walls. He would even do this if I simply was standing in his way while he watched television.

Once when we were at a store I hid among some plants in the garden section and lept out to surprise him, roaring like a monster. He turned and punched me in the stomach with full adult force, knocking the wind out of me and sending me sprawling to the ground. His response was "That will teach you to act civilized."  When my Grandmother saw the bruises from the event she threatened to call Child Protective Services on him. My mother talked her down by promising that it would never happen again.

It was that risk of danger to me that finally pushed my mother to escape his violence. She went to the elders of their congregation and told them about the abuse that we were enduring and the violence he performed. When the elders confronted my father about his actions, he denied it, gaslighting my mother. At that time the JW faith had no policies for handling domestic abuse, and since my father would not admit his wrongdoing, the elders took his side. My mother was told that it was her responsibility to be subordinate to her husband, and that biblically she could not end their marriage unless he had committed adultery. Thus it was that in 1990 she and my father separated without divorce, and she took me two towns over to Mount Pleasant, Michigan, where my grandparents lived (separately). It would be another ten years before my dad finally filed for legal divorce, tho under the JW faith they can never remarry.
