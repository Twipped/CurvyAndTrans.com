Today is Witchy Wednesday, and the Vatican says trans people are "annihilating nature", so I’m bringing the wrath of Gaia.

There is nothing unnatural about being trans, it's [a perfectly biological state](/p/A37736/i-am-biologically-female/), a product of human reproduction and variance within ecology. The processes we use to medically transition are also fully natural, and merely take advantage of systems that are already present in human biology.

For real tho, I had a fan blowing on me because it’s so hot right now and I didn’t want to sweat. I stood in front of the camera, my cloak billowed out, and I went “Well that’s a mood.”
