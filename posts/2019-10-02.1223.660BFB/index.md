The first woman I ever dated said to me on our first date, “You are unlike any man I have ever dated before.” She could see it. She didn’t know what it was, but she could see it.

It’s in the attitudes, the mannerisms, the way we address the world and the subtle interactions. If you get a group of trans women together and watch how they converse, the alignment is plain as day.

This is our tribe.
