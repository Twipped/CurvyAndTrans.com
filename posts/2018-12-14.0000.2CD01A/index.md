What do you do when your wife takes your new dress? Steal one of hers, of course.

I kid, we’re both the same size, so it’s just one big closet. The dress is a little bit tight on me, and from looking at the size chart it's actually meant for someone with a waist 10 inches smaller than me, but it's very stretchy, and that's all the better to show off my curves. Yeah, I got rolls, aren’t they hot?

This black coverup was another Ross find. I’ve been searching around for more lace and mesh covers to wear as a top layer.
