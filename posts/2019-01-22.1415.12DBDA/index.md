March 6th 2016. Todays Transformation Tuesday is a twofer. You may be wondering, what happened to the puppy? Well, he got bigger.

What was supposed to be an Australian Shepherd ended up being 50lbs of Cattle Dog and Border Collie mix. He was a great dog, very loyal and smart, but extremely stubborn and much too large for our home. He now lives on a vineyard in Napa Valley.
