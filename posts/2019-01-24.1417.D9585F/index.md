Todays look didn’t turn out as good as I had hoped. The lighting in my bedroom was atrocious this morning, and the dress didn’t sit the way I expected it to (but it’s very comfy, and has pockets). I’m very pleased with my eye look today, tho. I’ve included photos of the pallets I used for it. Also very happy with my lip contouring.
