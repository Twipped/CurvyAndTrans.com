Today’s outfit is a repeat, so I figured I’d throw in a twirl. Didn’t stick to the sheer kimono tho, it’s too cold and dreary today.

We have been getting so many amazing messages of support from so many people for yesterday’s post. It sounds like it had a significant impact for some people, Kat and I are both really glad that it touched so many people. Please don’t hesitate to share the url, either. We want people to see that marriage CAN survive transition.
