Something really shitty happened yesterday and I’m still reeling from it. I might end up deleting this post later, but this shit needs to be heard.

This week marked 18 months since I came out and switched identities at work. A year and a half later, almost all of my co-workers know me as and treat me as a woman… all except for one person.

My boss has continued to regularly call me “he” when talking to others within the company. It happens the most when I’m not in the room, but it also has happened when I’m literally standing in front of him. He is the type of guy who talks at a mile a minute, with no pauses to reply until he has completely finished whatever diatribe he’s on about. He also talks REALLY loudly, the man yells about everything. Thus, every time it happens, there is never an opportunity for me to correct him without literally screaming at him, which I won’t do. Sometimes five minutes will go by before he pauses to let someone else speak, and by then he’s so far away from the moment that if I DO bring it up, he has no idea what I’m talking about.

Three times I have had conversations with him about this, the third time it ended in me crying in front of him out of sheer frustration that a person can label himself a woke ally and continue to be so deaf to these kinds of issues. It’s impossible to tell him that he’s doing something wrong, because he will instantly go on the hostile defense. He’s also the type of man that, upon hearing a story about your own lived experience, will then explain to you why you’re wrong... about your own life.

In short, he’s the quintessential white male liberal,  so convinced of his own moral superiority that any challenge to his own world view, any criticism of his behavior, is perceived as a personal attack. I’m sure right now some of you are nodding your heads in understanding of exactly this character archetype.

Yesterday I approached him for the fourth time because on Wednesday he misgendered me twice during the company organization development meeting (literally the meeting meant to improve our company’s social awareness). All I wanted was an acknowledgment of the harm and an apology. I didn’t get that far.

He quickly descended into “you don’t know how hard this is” and “you need to be patient with me.” There was no apology, there wasn’t even an acknowledgment that he made a mistake. Then it slid into “you just have to accept that my brain can’t make this change.”

Seriously, he seriously told me that I should just give up on him getting pronouns right. That this is clearly too hard for him to fix and that I just have to get used to it. Mind you, he hasn’t deadnamed me in over six months, but he can still think of the name Jocelyn, and then in the same sentence use the word “he”. I’ve watched this cause confusion amongst co-workers who don’t know I’m transgender, and then can’t figure out who he means.

This sort of thing always happens for one reason: The person has not changed how they categorize the trans person. In his brain I am still filed under male. This is a known fact of psychology, when a person continues to fail to use pronouns, it is because internally they are still not viewing the person as owning those pronouns. They only are indulging someone a courtesy, and thus fall down when their courtesy is limited.

I pointed this out. He instantly became defensively hostile, his voice raised by 50% and the pointy finger came out. “Get out of my head, don’t you dare tell me how I think of you.” Then he proceeded to explain that when he thinks of me he recalls what I looked like 5 years ago, literally confirming exactly what I said.

Then came the whopper. “I am offended that you are bothered by this.” That’s right folks, not only did he make it about himself, he made himself the victim.

I. Was. Livid.

“NO! You do NOT get to be offended right now, that is NOT how this works.” I went back to my desk, hastily packed up my laptop, and stormed out of the office, telling him to fuck off as I walked out the door. I struggled to contain my anger until I got to my car and then rage cried for ten minutes into my steering wheel.

I just cannot with this man. He dares to call himself an ally, he honestly thinks he’s a woke liberal, and then he goes and pulls this bigoted horse shit. The man is so convinced of his own moral superiority that he not only doesn’t listen to others, he get’s angry if anyone challenges his behavior. I am so, SO sick of white cis male “allies”.
