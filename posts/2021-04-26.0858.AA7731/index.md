Imagine that, having been diagnosed with a heart condition, or hypothyroidism, or asthma, or any number of other long term medical conditions, you had to get re-diagnosed every single time you went in for treatment. If every time you change doctors, you had to justify to that doctor that your previous diagnosis was accurate. If you had to prove that, yes, I am actually sick, even when you have been taking the medications for years.

That is the state of trans healthcare. Every every time you change prescribers, you have to prove to the doctor that, yes, I really am the gender I say I am and that's why I've been on hormone therapy for five years. Every gender affirming surgery you pursue, even ones that don't require pre-auth to do on cis people (such as breast augmentations/reductions), requires multiple _new_ letters (they wont take the old ones) affirming that, yes, you are the gender you say you are and no you are not delusional or suffering from psychosis. This continues to be required no matter how long you have lived as your true self.

Even though I look like a woman, have been living as a woman for over three years, have been taking estrogen for nearly four years, and *have no freaking testicles*, I will yet again have to justify that I am actually transgender in order to pursue any future surgeries. Even trans people who have had bottom surgery still experience these hoops.

Yet conservative pundits and legislators would have you believe that we just walk into a clinic and they hand us a prescription, that a female assigned person can just dial up a surgeon and have their uterus removed (even cis women have to jump through hoops to make that happen).
