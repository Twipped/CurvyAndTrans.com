Today while at the beach I noticed people watching me as I walk past, and I think to myself: "Are they staring because I’m fat, or because this swim suit is bomb?"‬

And then it occurred to me, "because I’m trans" wasn’t in that list.‬

We had a great day at the beach, just two moms with our kids. I sunburned the hell out of my left foot, tho.
