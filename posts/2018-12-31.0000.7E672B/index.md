Happy New Years Eve everyone!

I got this lace cami from Shein last week and today was my first chance to wear it. I absolutely love the look, it accents my lower cut dresses so well. Unfortunately the straps arenâ€™t adjustable and it keeps slipping down my chest, but I think I can shorten them with a little bit of sewing.

The lace cardigan that I'm wearing over the dress was a Ross find, made by Espresso.

The necklace is constructed from some beads I snagged out of my daughter's room, and a trans pendant made by the fantastic [Tattooed And Chained](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TattooedAndChained) on Etsy. Even if you're not of a queer persuasion you should absolutely check out her store, because she makes delightful chainmail and scale jewelry.
