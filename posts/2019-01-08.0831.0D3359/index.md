I finally managed to make it through breakfast without spilling anything on this dress.

I’m gonna be honest, I don’t think this dress is flattering on me. It hangs weird (even weirder when I had a cami under it), it’s not slimming, it does nothing to hide my lumps, but I’m ok with that. It’s still a comfy dress, and it makes my butt look fantastic.

Our Christmas tree is now all packed up for storage. Later today I’ll have to climb a ladder and shove it into the rafters of our garage. Tho I have a suspicion that next year my wife will want to buy a new one, since an entire row of lights on this one has gone out and I have no idea which is the offending bulb (nor do I have replacements).
