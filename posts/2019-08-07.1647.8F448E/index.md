Todays look is the same dress I’ve been in love with for the last two months, so I figured I’d focus on the makeup instead.

We’re interviewing a prospective new hire today, so I femmed it up to the max, and even did my nails. I like to test male applicants to see how they react to a woman with knowledge and authority in her field. If he gets mansplainy or condescending, or if I get talked over and interrupted, thats going to have a massive impact on his ability to function in this team. Especially since at the moment half of us are women.

Women in tech often feel the need to dress down their feminine presentation in order to be taken seriously, but I say fuck that. If you can’t respect me at my high femme, you don’t deserve me at my soft femme.

Let the games begin.
