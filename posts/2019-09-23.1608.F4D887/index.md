Felt cute this morning.

After yesterday’s party we all woke up exhausted and just beyond giving a damn, so I threw on a comfy bra and the first t-shirt I found in the pile of clean clothes waiting to put away. Of course, I still had to match my makeup to it, because I’m just extra like that I guess.
