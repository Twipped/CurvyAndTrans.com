Yesterday I dug up an old photo my mom took of me back in 2002, and I figured it was perfect for Transition Tuesday.

We were in the process of remodeling a tiny stone house she had just bought which was built in 1870. We gutted the entire thing, put in new plumbing, all new electrical, repaired the floor, poured a new slab for the part of the house that was added in the 1920s, rebuilt the walls that werenâ€™t the original stone, and replaced the roof.

Then she sold it three years later for twice what she spent on it and bought her and I separate mobile homes. And that was how I finally moved out of her house at the age of 25.
