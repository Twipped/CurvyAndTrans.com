Black and gold and full of fire. I haven’t worn this dress since our wedding anniversary.

Happy with my makeup today despite my wife’s grumbling about my lip color (she hates dark lips). There’s like five different lip products at play here, plus a concealer around the edges. It’s hard but worth it. The gold on my eyelids is actually a highlighter, Fenty Trophy Wife. It's so strong that I almost never use it as an actual highlight because it makes my entire cheeks sparkle golden.
