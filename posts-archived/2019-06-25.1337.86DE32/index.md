Two weeks ago I met a young trans girl online through one of my social groups. She’s barely twenty years old, pre-hrt, has known she’s trans for four years, and is stuck living with her unaccepting parents. No car, no job, no school, no opportunities to escape. The poor thing was absolutely distraught because she had no idea how to get out of the hell she is trapped in.⁣

So what’s a girl to do? I took her under my wing. I’ve been counseling her, guiding her towards starting HRT, giving her advice on vocal training and ways to help alleviate her dysphoria. We’ve been talking every night, and in just a week’s time she has gone from being on the verge of collapse to having a ton of hope for the future.⁣

The change in her has been amazing, and all it took was having a parental figure who actually cared about her and respected her. I can not wait to see how much she blossoms once she’s started hormone therapy. I have so many hopes and dreams for her future.⁣

Last night when we said our goodnights she signed off with “I love you, mom.” My heart melted. I wish I could just fly her here to California and help her start an entirely new life, but there’s just only so much help one trans mom can provide.⁣

I love the look of a petticoat. I do not love the feel of my petticoat. By the time I got to the office I was thoroughly annoyed by it and left it in my car (If anyone has a suggestion for a comfy petticoat that’s not expensive, please let me know). Disappointing, too, because it massively enhanced this dress.
