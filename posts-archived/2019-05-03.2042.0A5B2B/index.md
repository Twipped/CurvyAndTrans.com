Continuing my timeline series, this post is about facial changes. These before pictures are from 2014 and 2015.

I think the thing that strikes me the most isnâ€™t how my eyes changed, or how my skin is so much clearer, or how much progress Iâ€™ve had on hair removal... Itâ€™s my double chin. I actually have a neck now! While thereâ€™s still a lot of lose skin there (which Iâ€™d like to get removed), just the simple fact that you can see my jaw is amazing.

Mind you, this isnâ€™t *entirely* from HRT, I did lose 30-40 pounds between these sets, but still... itâ€™s a marvelous change.

Funny story: The photo where my head is completely shaved... this was the result of a gamble. Katharine was absolutely certain that I would look good with a buzz cut and I promised her that she was completely wrong. I won the bet, she was SO disappointed ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
