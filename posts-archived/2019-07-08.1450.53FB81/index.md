Marriage is hard.

It takes ever constant patience and understanding, presence of mind, and an awareness of all the ways your words and actions affect those you love. It’s a struggle that can pay off in huge sums, but when you falter... you both get hurt.

It’s especially hard when you’re a 15 year old in a 38 year old body with adult responsibilities, but all your adult experiences came from a completely different life.

My wife and I are not the people we were ten years ago, and when you’ve both changed so much it’s hard to find yourselves while also living the life you’ve made in the meantime. You have to force yourselves to make space for that discovery, or else the void will consume you.
