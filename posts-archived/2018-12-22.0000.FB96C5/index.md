This is the second time that my face has looked AMAZING after using this mask. I am 100% sold on this product!! This photo is fresh out of bed and untouched. No filters, no makeup. My redness is gone, my wrinkles are smaller, my pores are clear... I am hella impressed. This mask if going to become a regular treatment when I need to look really good.

I have two chief complaints:

1. The mask is clearly designed for a smaller face, the upper lip strip is laughably small.

2. I had to lay back while wearing it, because the goop was not adhesive enough to keep the mask against my upper lip and chin.
