Was feeling a little down this morning and was just laying around the house, but then decided to head over to Torrid to spend my gift cards. This is the Banana yellow Annabelle dress that I mentioned in the Disneyland post and [this post](/p/6A9556/berry-disgruntled/). I knew it'd be easy to take off in a changing room, and it's nice and bright.
