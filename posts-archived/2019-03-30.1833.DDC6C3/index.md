Family trip today down to The San Diego Zoo. Despite wearing two different sunscreens, I still managed to get a burn on my cheeks because I forgot to bring a damn hat.

It was a good outing, up until my daughter got tired and started getting petulant, so we cut the trip a little shorter than we planned.

Iâ€™ve never seen the zoo this busy before, we forgot that it was spring break.
