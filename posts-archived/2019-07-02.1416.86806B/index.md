Went pretty basic yesterday with my makeup, no foundation or BB cream, just a whole lot of glow.

I think this dress might be just a wee bit short on me. I’ve never worn it without leggings before, and there were a few times I was very glad I had shorts on underneath.

I’m trying a new app to color correct my photos, Adobe Lightroom Mobile. I’ve been doing it on my mac for the last few months because I couldn’t find anything on iOS that did what I needed it to do. I’m feeling like this is a winner, what you all think? It let me create a preset that cut my editing time in half.
