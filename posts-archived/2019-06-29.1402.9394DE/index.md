Our local community had their second annual #pride festival today, so I broke out my colors.

It was a bit bigger this year, more booths, quite a bit more people, and best of all a lot more families. Last year we were the only people there with kids in tow. Not many other trans people my age, but quite a few teens and a lot of allies. Trans Family Support Services and the Poway library hosted the event.

My son kept stealing the show by wondering up to the podium and cheering really loud whenever people applauded ðŸ˜‚
