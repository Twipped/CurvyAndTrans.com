Off to see my hormone doctor today. I always try to knock his socks off so that he doesnâ€™t fucking dare try to change the hormone regimen I designed.

It's not that there is a risk of him denying me treatment, this isn't some kind of Harry Benjamin gatekeeping thing... So far, for the last 21 months, I have set my own treatment plan. I explain my reasoning for any changes in dosage or additions of medications, and he decides if it's a good idea. The last time I saw him he made some noise about not liking how high my estrogen blood level was, and I'm concerned he might try to cut back my dosage. I go for the bang because I want to cement just how well my treatment plan has been working for me.

So far, so good. He's still not changed anything.
