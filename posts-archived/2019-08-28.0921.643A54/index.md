Real basic today.

I found this dress last week, at Walmart of all places, and is mad comfortable. The fabric is a butter soft rayon that hangs really nicely and just feels good to wear. This is from Walmartâ€™s Time and Tru brand (which sadly means it tops out at XXL), comes in five colors, and was only $10! AND IT HAS POCKETS!

Not too thrilled with how the photos came out today, lighting in our bedroom was weird this morning. I also forgot to do my skincare this morning, so my face is a mess. Ah well.
