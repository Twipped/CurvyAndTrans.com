Feeling really cute today, absolutely will NOT delete later.

Got this dress Sunday from Torrid, off the clearance rack, and got it for free because I bought that black dress as well. Loving this pinkish red, and the fabric is really soft, but mostly it just feels really comfy and spritely. I kept finding myself dancing around the house.

Saw the new Godzilla last night. The film is absolutely dreadful, terribly written, highly contrived, full of plot holes and riddled with cliches... but was ridiculously fun and I absolutely loved it!
