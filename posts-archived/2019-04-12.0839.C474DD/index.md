Iâ€™m not expecting to leave the house again this afternoon, so I decided to just skip the bra and throw on a comfy dress. I HATE the way I look without a bra on, the loss of support makes my chest nearly flat, and thatâ€™s so frustrating to me. It used to make me highly dysphoric, but these days itâ€™s more of a disappointment. I love my breasts, I just wish they put forth more effort on their own ðŸ˜†

Anyway, I thought this was a good opportunity for a body positivity post. This is me without support, no makeup, no filter, my hair untouched, freshly out of a shower after a sweaty morning of hauling trash out to the recycling center. Iâ€™m enjoying what little bit of peace and quiet I have before my son wakes from his nap and my daughter comes home from school (and the start of spring break).
