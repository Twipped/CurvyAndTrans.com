I went for the full diva today. It’s been a while since I really glammed it up, and after a really long week of not getting out of the house much, I needed this.

It really surprises me how much I look like my grandmother in some of these photos. She’s a huge narcissist, a trait that I hope I am avoiding, but she was also always the quintessential prima donna and I often looked up to the way she carried herself when I was a teen.
