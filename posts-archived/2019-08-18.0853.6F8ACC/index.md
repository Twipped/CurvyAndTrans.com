This week I launched a Facebook page for Curvy and Trans. It mirrors a lot of the content here on Instagram, but also receives things that are difficult to share here (such as links to articles and videos), and resharing of any FB posts that I find pertinent to either fat positively, plus size fashion, or the trans experience.

I have also created a Facebook Group, connected to this page, called The Trans Fats. My goal is to create a space for trans focused discussions and support on body positivity and fat positivity. Cis people and non-fats are welcome, just recognize that it is a trans and fat centering group.
