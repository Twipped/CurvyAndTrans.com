I went full diva yesterday.

If I look tired, it’s because I was *exhausted*. It turns out that one of the side effects of Lexapro is insomnia. When I took this photo I was running on about four hours of sleep out of the last 48. Thankfully it’s supposed to be temporary, and I think I got a good nights rest last night.

It occurred to me today why I get so emotional when I think about how thankful I am that Kat chose to stick out my transition and make it work. Her acceptance and diligence was an implicit gift of permission. She allowed me to be me, even tho I still would have done it without her at my side.

It’s like when a partner’s parents give their blessing for marriage. The blessing isn’t needed, and you’d still get married even if they refused, but having it makes you feel better about it. You know that they believe in you and that this is the right path for you to take.
