When my wife saw my makeup this morning she goes “Oh Jesus...”.

I’m like “Yeah, but it works with the outfit, right?”

“Yeah, I guess.“

Then she says “Look, just because I’m boring and judgmental doesn’t mean you should limit yourself.”

Last few images in this set are what happens when I listen to System of a Down while photographing.
