Calling this look “Sunny Gothic”

My original plan for the makeup was a smokey eye with lemon yellow accents, but it got a bit away from me. I felt with that strong of an eye look, the dress called for a chain and sheer black cardigan.

I’m glad this dress still fits. It had been getting a bit loose in the chest the last few times I wore it, but with my newest bra I’m finally filling it out properly.
