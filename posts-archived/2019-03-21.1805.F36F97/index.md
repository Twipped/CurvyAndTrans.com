I think I would have been 6 or 7 years old here.

What you see behind me? That was my back yard! Including about an acre of the forest.

The puppy was named Griffen, and my mom got him for me so that I would have a companion when I went gallivanting through the woods. There is a creek that flows through the forest, and I would trek up and down its length for about half a mile in either direction. I’d take off back and head on home when it started to get dark. Ah, the joys of rural Michigan life in the 80s.

My mom cut my hair. Can you tell? 😏
