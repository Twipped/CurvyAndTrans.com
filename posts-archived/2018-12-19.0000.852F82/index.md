What would you call this look? Nerd-Grunge? I knew I wanted to wear a t-shirt and skirt today but beyond that this outfit just kind of happened. ðŸ˜…

Lighting in my bedroom was weird this morning, far too warm colored, I had to tone adjust every photo because everything looked orange. Downside of having so much natural light, itâ€™s unpredictable.
