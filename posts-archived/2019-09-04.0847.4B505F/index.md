This is what happens when Be Prepared starts playing right as I being photographing. You get a villainess.

CW: Eating, maybe dieting.

Fat shifting has suddenly picked up pace again despite my weight still remaining steady. Discovered over the weekend that I’ve lost another two inches off my waist, and my second chin is getting looser. I think my butt got larger, and my hip dips have filled in more.

I’m wondering if this is the result of the Wellbutrin, as my eating habits have changed a bit over the last week. I’m eating less at breakfast and lunch due to just not wanting more food, but then craving protein and carbs at dinner. I think it’s causing fat cycling across the day, and thats making things migrate.
