Woke up feeling like Queen Bitch of the Universe. It’s funny how I always use red lipstick when I’m in a bad mood.

Spent most of yesterday trying to figure out why I was so grouchy, and then it finally hit me in the shower. Bad mood, headache, face breaking out, constantly slamming hershey’s kisses into my mouth…

Been a while since I had PMS this bad, hoping thats not a portent for what’s coming later this week. I was two days late with my last E shot, and thats probably made for a rough cycle.
