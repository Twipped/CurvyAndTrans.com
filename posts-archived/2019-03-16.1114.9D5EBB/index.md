For the last few weeks I've been searching for some kind of cropped cardigan that didn't fall below my waist line. Something that would cover my shoulders but not obscure the skirt of a dress. The problem is, most plus size boleros I've been finding on Amazon are tailored, or are shrugs that button at the neck line, neither of which was what I wanted. I was looking specifically for a draped cardigan, preferably in cotton or rayon.  Just finding plus size boleros on Amazon is a needle in a haystack, thanks to all the asian manufacturers flooding the marketplace is products that aren't even in US sizes, much less plus sizes. Half the products returned by any given search don't even match my search terms, and 3/4 of the ones that do match aren't actually in my size.

Why am I stuck to Amazon? There's dozens of plus size brands that make nice cropped cardigans, why not just shop there? In a word, money. I can't afford to spend $40-60 on a cardigan. This past month I had exactly $100 to spend on myself, and half of that went to buying some new skincare products from Sephora. The rest ends up going to snacks or drinks, typically. But, this month I got a $50 Amazon gift card as cash back on a credit card, and that gave me a chance to buy some clothes I wanted.

Finally I struck gold. Modern Kiwi makes this cute little rayon cardigan that is pretty much exactly what I wanted, and it was cheap enough that it only took a fraction of the gift card. I absolutely love it, and now I want to buy it in three more colors.

It's 80F degrees (26.6C) today in our area, so I figured that called for a summer dress and sandals. I love being able to layer, but I'm also ready for warmer weather. This dress is one of the few Xhileration sun dresses that Target carried in 3X last year, and I'm hoping to see a return of something like this for this summer. I remember in my 20s always being excited for summer because it meant women in sun dresses, and now I'm so thrilled that I get to wear them too.
