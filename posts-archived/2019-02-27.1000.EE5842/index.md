This dress was the first outfit I ever posted to instagram, which means I haven’t worn it in almost four months. I wore a corset under it last time, and it was the first time I’d ever fit into a size 20. No corset today, I’m letting the belly out, but the dress still fits pretty well.

This is day two of finally using DevaCurl conditioner, and I think I can see a difference? Might be too early to tell, but I feel like the curls have a lot more life in them today.

Not gonna lie, I’m quite thrilled with how much better my chest looks now compared to back then.
