In exchange for building my mother in law a new computer, she gave me a very generous gift card for Torrid, and this amazing outfit is the first of the gains from that gift.

I LOVE this dress, I feel so incredibly pretty right now, and the shoes are exactly what I’ve been trying to find. The shoes are actually a little big on me, the bands aren’t quite as snug as they should be, but I’m still gonna wear them out because I feel stunning today.

I also owe a lot of this look to this fabulous City Chic Multiway Bra that [@sparkelsandlace](https://www.instagram.com/sparklesandlace/) pointed out to me. I've been searching for both a good lifting bra *and* a strapless bra, and this one completely fit the bill. I have cleavage again! I've been without since I outgrew my old Cacique Lifting Plunge bra. Citi Chic has earned my massive respect, and I'll definitely be shopping there in the future. Technically this bra is a cup size too small, but they only go up to a G.
