Had a crummy morning, so none of this is what I meant to do today. My dysphoria is rising, so it’s probably PMS.
C’est la vie.

At least this dress is really cute. I bought this dress off Amazon in two different colors, Berry and Banana, because both of them had preview images of a light yellow and I want a yellow dress for our Disneyland trip next month. As I expected, the Berry dress was not yellow when it arrived. What I did not expect what the quality difference between the Berry and the Banana. Even before I opened the package it was clear there was a quality difference between them, since the berry dress was a larger and heavier package. Once open, the cloth was very clearly thicker on the berry, and softer as well. The yellow dress felt like the cheap knit that is used on mens undershirts; kind of stiff, and extremely transparent. This was even more obvious when I put the two dresses on, as my underwear was very visible through the dress. The elastic around the waist was also a lot more durable on the berry vs the banana, and the bustier was taller. The banana keeps trying to pull up over my bra.

I've ordered a different Annabelle dress in Mustard, and we'll see if it too has this thin material. It's very curious, because none of the other reviewers who bought the banana complained about it being so thin, and it's clear in the customer photos that it isn't. It makes me think that the banana was a knockoff dress.

Anyway, the Berry is super comfortable and look really nice, plus it has pockets! Very nice short dress for the price, I strongly recommend it.
