Today I found my old house slippers from three years ago, and it’s just simply astonishing how enormous they are on my feet. It’s hard to get a good photo of it, but there is like two inches of space behind my heel. I feel like a kid in her dad’s shoes, my feet have shrank that much. Hormones are magic.

For the record, I went from a men’s 12 to a women’s 11W, a drop of three sizes.

Incidentally, my hands got smaller too. I went down three ring sizes, and lost about half an inch on my middle finger. I used to be able to completely envelope my wife’s fist in my palm, but now our fingers are close to the same length (hers are still thinner, cuz bones).
