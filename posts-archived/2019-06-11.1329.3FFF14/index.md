Feel really cute tonight. My mood has been so much better the last week or so, and it’s pretty clear that the Lexapro is working. My anxiety has been really low, and even tho I’ve still had a few trigger moments, in general I feel a whole lot better.

I should have gotten on an antidepressant WAY sooner.
