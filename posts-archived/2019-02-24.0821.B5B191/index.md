Monday is Katharine's birthday, and she asked me to make her a cake. Kat is obsessed with Harry Potter, so for her birthday we found a recipe for Harry's birthday cake from the first book. It's a layered chocolate cake with chocolate butter cream frosting.

I did make one mistake during the preparation, but it wasn't my fault. The instructions said to spray the pans with non-stick cooking spray. This is wrong, never use spray on baked goods, the oil gets pushed around by the batter, resulting in ungreased portions of the pan under the batter. You should always grease a pan with butter or shortening instead, which is thick enough that the batter flows over it instead of disturbing it.

I know this, but I didn't think about it because Samantha was helping me make the cake and we just followed the instructions as they were. As a result, the layers stuck to the pans and came off a little bit broken.  Oh well, nothing you can't fix with a generous mortar of very thick frosting. Ultimately the recipe produced so much frosting that I couldn't use it all, so we saved it to put on other things. I've been putting it in my morning oatmeal.

The end result was delicious, it was a really great cake. It's also an _extremely_ rich cake, possibly the sweetest cake I have ever had. One slice was so intense that I had trouble sleeping.
