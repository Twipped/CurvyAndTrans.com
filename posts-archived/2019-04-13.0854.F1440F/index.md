We’re off to IKEA, which merited an outfit change since I am NOT hauling furniture boxes in an underwire bra. I swung by Target this morning and found this black cami dress... which isn’t actually a dress. 😛 It’s from the sleepwear department, one of the new offerings by Stars Above. Stick a bolero over it and no-one’s the wiser.

Unfortunately this brand just goes to XXL, and it was a tight fit to get it on (one of those “one boob at a time” kind of fits 😄), but it’s REALLY soft and comfy.

It’s also the first thing I’ve bought with enough built in support that I feel ok wearing it without a bra. Think I'll need to get a few more of these.
