So apparently the secret to getting really great smiles out of me is to get me singing while I shoot.

I haven’t worn these jeggings in over a year.. they fit a bit better now... and are actually a little loose below the butt. This tunic is another one of my Torrid buys from a fee days ago. I love it, but also discovered this morning that it’s WAY too low of a neckline for me to wear without a cami (see bonus pic).
