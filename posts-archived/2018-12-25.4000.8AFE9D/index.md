Today Apple Photos prompted me if a photo was of my mother. It was a photo of me. I really do look a lot like my mom now, when she was closer to my age. My head is slightly taller, and I’m still fatter than she was then, but the features are astonishingly close.

Of course that also means most of the things I hate in my face aren’t because of growing up on testosterone, they’re just my genetics. Thats both reassuring and also extremely aggravating.

People used to say my daughter looked just like my mom. Turns out she looks just like me! My son too, he’s the spitting image of me at that age.
