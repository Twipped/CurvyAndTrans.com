Amusingly, my wife left the house to get Starbucks while I cooked breakfast. ðŸ˜„

Hereâ€™s how we make bacon in our household.

1. Take out an insulated cookie sheet (uninsulated if you like it burnt). 2. Get a large sheet of aluminum foil, enough to cover the entire sheet. It has to be a single sheet, two overlapping wonâ€™t work. I use the big costco size rolls.

3. Curl up the sheet at the edges so that the bacon fat wonâ€™t flow off the sheet.

4. Lay out your bacon strips, alternating direction for maximum space.

5. If you want candied bacon, sprinkle some brown sugar over the strips.

6. Put it in a cold oven, do not preheat, and set the oven to 450Â°F (230 C). 7. Set a time for 10-15 minutes. Youâ€™ll have to play with the time depending on how fast your oven warms up and the cut of the bacon.

8. After the time is up, pull out the sheet and transfer the bacon to paper towel with tongs. Let cool 5 minutes.

This doesnâ€™t produce the crispiest bacon, but it always tastes amazing.
