This weeks Witchy Wednesday: Fire Witch / Priestess of the Flame.

Drug Diary:   
I’m seeing tiny signs that the Trintellix is starting to do its thing. I’ve had a sudden spike in executive function, busted out a whole ton of house cleaning this morning before I got ready for work, and I wasn’t even procrastinating! Accomplished a lot at the office as well, didn’t even get distracted enough to make this post until I got home.

This is supposed to be a thing the drug helps with, but it’s a wee bit early to be certain. Have yet to experience any side effects yet, either from going on to the Trintellix or from coming off the Lexapro.

In uglier news, I seem to have caught my daughter’s cold. My nose has been running all afternoon.
